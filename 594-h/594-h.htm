    <h2>
      CHRISTMAS DAY.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 The Christmas chimes are pealing high
  Beneath the solemn Christmas sky,
  And blowing winds their notes prolong
      Like echoes from an angel's song;
  Good will and peace, peace and good will
      Ring out the carols glad and gay,
  Telling the heavenly message still
      That Christ the Child was born to-day.

 In lowly hut and palace hall
  Peasant and king keep festival,
  And childhood wears a fairer guise,
  And tenderer shine all mother-eyes;
  The aged man forgets his years,
      The mirthful heart is doubly gay,
  The sad are cheated of their tears,
      For Christ the Lord was born to-day.

     They sat on the curbing
      In a crowded row&mdash;
      Two little maids
           And one little beau,&mdash;
      Watching to see
           The big Elephant go
                By in the street parade;
      But when it came past,
           Of maids there were none,
      For down a by-street
           They cowardly run,
      While one little beau
           Made all manner of fun&mdash;
                Of the Elephant he wasn't afraid.

    <h2>
      THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One hundred years' and one ago, in Boston, at ten of the clock one April
      night, a church steeple had been climbed and a lantern hung out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten, the same night, in mid-river of the Charles, oarsmen two, with
      passenger silent and grim, had seen the signal light out-swung, and rowed
      with speed for the Charlestown shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven, the moon was risen, and the grim passenger, Paul Revere, had
      ridden up the Neck, encountered a foe, who opposed his ride into the
      country, and, after a brief delay, rode on, leaving a British officer
      lying in a clay pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At mid-night, a hundred ears had heard the flying horseman cry, "Up and
      arm. The Regulars are coming out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You know the story well. You have heard how the wild alarm ran from voice
      to voice and echoed beneath every roof, until the men of Lexington and
      Concord were stirred and aroused with patriotic fear for the safety of the
      public stores that had been committed to their keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know how, long ere the chill April day began to dawn, they had drawn,
      by horse power and by hand power, the cherished stores into safe
      hiding-places in the depth of friendly forest-coverts.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one thing about that day that you have NOT heard and I will tell
      you now. It is, how one little woman staid in the town of Concord, whence
      all the women save her had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the houses that were standing then, are very old-fashioned now, but
      there was one dwelling-place on Concord Common that was old-fashioned even
      then! It was the abode of Martha Moulton and "Uncle John." Just who "Uncle
      John" was, is not now known, but he was probably Martha Moulton's uncle.
      The uncle, it appears by record, was eighty-five years old; while the
      niece was ONLY three-score and eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once and again that morning, a friendly hand had pulled the latch-string
      at Martha Moulton's kitchen entrance and offered to convey herself and
      treasures away, but, to either proffer, she had said: "No, I must stay
      until Uncle John gets the cricks out of his back, if all the British
      soldiers in the land march into town."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, came Joe Devins, a lad of fifteen years&mdash;Joe's two
      astonished eyes peered for a moment into Martha Moulton's kitchen, and
      then eyes and owner dashed into the room, to learn, what the sight he
      there saw, could mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whew! Mother Moulton, what are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm getting Uncle John his breakfast to be sure, Joe," she answered.
      "Have you seen so many sights this morning that you don't know breakfast,
      when you see it? Have a care there, for hot fat WILL burn," as she deftly
      poured the contents of a pan, fresh from the fire, into a dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hungry Joe had been astir since the first drum had beat to arms at two of
      the clock. He gave one glance at the boiling cream and the slices of crisp
      pork swimming in it, as he gasped forth the words, "Getting breakfast in
      Concord THIS morning! MOTHER MOULTON, you MUST be crazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they tell me," she said, serenely. "There comes Uncle John!" she
      added, as the clatter of a staff on the stone steps of the stairway
      outrang, for an instant, the cries of hurrying and confusion that filled
      the air of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know, Mother Moulton," Joe went on to say, "that every single
      woman and child have been carried off, where the Britishers won't find
      'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe the king's troops have stirred out of Boston," she
      replied, going to the door leading to the stone staircase, to open it for
      Uncle John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't believe it?" and Joe looked, as he echoed the words, as though only
      a boy could feel sufficient disgust at such want of common sense, in full
      view of the fact, that Reuben Brown had just brought the news that eight
      men had been killed by the king's Red-coats, in Lexington, which fact he
      made haste to impart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't believe a word of it," she said, stoutly, "until I see the
      soldiers coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Hear that!" cried Joe, tossing back his hair and swinging his arms
      triumphantly at an airy foe. "You won't have to wait long. THAT SIGNAL is
      for the minute men. They are going to march out to meet the Red-coats.
      Wish I was a minute man, this minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, poor Uncle John was getting down the steps of the stairway,
      with many a grimace and groan. As he touched the floor, Joe, his face
      beaming with excitement and enthusiasm, sprang to place a chair for him at
      the table, saying, "Good morning!" at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May be," groaned Uncle John, "youngsters LIKE YOU may think it is a good
      morning, but I DON'T, such a din and clatter as the fools have kept up all
      night long. If I had the power" (and now the poor old man fairly groaned
      with rage), "I'd make 'em quiet long enough to let an old man get a wink
      of sleep, when the rheumatism lets go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm real sorry for you," said Joe, "but you don't know the news. The
      king's troops, from camp, in Boston, are marching right down here, to
      carry off all our arms that they can find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they?" was the sarcastic rejoined. "It's the best news I've heard in
      a long while. Wish they had my arms, this minute. They wouldn't carry them
      a step farther than they could help, I know. Run and tell them mine are
      ready, Joe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Uncle John, wait till after breakfast, you'll want to use them once
      more," said Martha Moulton, trying to help him into the chair that Joe had
      placed on the white sanded floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Joe Devins had ears for all the sounds that penetrated the
      kitchen from out of doors, and he had eyes for the slices of well-browned
      pork and the golden hued Johnny-cake lying before the glowing coals on the
      broad hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the little woman bent to take up the breakfast, Joe, intent on doing
      some kindness for her in the way of saving treasures, asked, "Shan't I
      help you, Mother Moulton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon I am not so old that I can't lift a mite of cornbread," she
      replied with chilling severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I didn't mean to lift THAT THING," he made haste to explain, "but to
      carry off things and hide 'em away, as everybody else has been doing half
      the night. I know a first-rate place up in the woods. Used to be a honey
      tree, you know, and it's just as hollow as anything. Silver spoons and
      things would be just as safe in it&mdash;" but Joe's words were
      interrupted by unusual tumult on the street and he ran off to learn the
      news, intending to return and get the breakfast that had been offered to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he rushed back to the house with cheeks aflame and eyes ablaze
      with excitement. "They're a coming!" he cried. "They're in sight down by
      the rocks. They see 'em marching, the men on the hill, do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mean that its really true that the soldiers are coming here,
      RIGHT INTO OUR TOWN," cried Martha Moulton, rising in haste and bringing
      together with rapid flourishes to right and to left, every fragment of
      silver on the table. Uncle John strove to hold fast his individual spoon,
      but she twitched it without ceremony out from his rheumatic old fingers,
      and ran next to the parlor cupboard, wherein lay her movable valuables.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world shall I do with them," she cried, returning with her
      apron well filled with treasures, and borne down by the weight thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give 'em to me," cried Joe. "Here's a basket, drop 'em in, and I'll run
      like a brush-fire through the town and across the old bridge, and hide 'em
      as safe as a weasel's nap."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe's fingers were creamy; his mouth was half filled with Johnny-cake, and
      his pocket on the right bulged to its utmost capacity with the same, as he
      held forth the basket; but the little woman was afraid to trust him, as
      she had been afraid to trust her neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No!" she replied, to his repeated offers. "I know what I'll do. You,
      Joe Devins, stay right where you are till I come back, and, don't you ever
      LOOK out of the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear me!" she cried, flushed and anxious when she was out of sight
      of Uncle John and Joe. "I WISH I'd given 'em to Col. Barrett when he was
      here before daylight, only, I WAS afraid I should never get sight of them
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew off one of her stockings, filled it, tied the opening at the top
      with a string-plunged stocking and all into a pail full of water and
      proceeded to pour the contents into the well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the dark circle had closed over the blue stockings, Joe Devin's
      face peered down the depths by her side, and his voice sounded out the
      words: "O Mother Moulton, the British will search the wells the VERY first
      thing. Of course, they EXPECT to find things in wells!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you tell me before, Joe? but now it is too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would, if I'd known what you was going to do; they'd been a sight
      safer, in the honey tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and what a fool I've been&mdash;flung MY WATCH into the well with
      the spoons!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well! Don't stand there, looking," as she hovered over the high
      curb, with her hand on the bucket. "Everybody will know, if you do,
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Martha! Martha?" shrieked Uncle John's quavering voice from the house
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless my heart!" she exclaimed, hurrying back over the stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with your heart?" questioned Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. I was thinking of Uncle John's money," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he got money?" cried Joe. "I thought he was poor, and you took care
      of him because you were so good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one word that Joe uttered did the little woman hear. She was already
      by Uncle John's side and asking him for the key to his strong box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle John's rheumatism was terribly exasperating. "No, I won't give it to
      you!" he cried, "and nobody shall have it as long as I'm above ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the soldiers will carry it off," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let 'em!" was his reply, grasping his staff firmly with both hands and
      gleaming defiance out of his wide, pale eyes. "YOU won't get the key, even
      if they do."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, a voice at the doorway shouted the words, "Hide, hide
      away somewhere, Mother Moulton, for the Red-coats are in sight this
      minute!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the warning, and giving one glance at Uncle John, which look was
      answered by another, "no, you won't have it," she grasped Joe Devins by
      the collar of his jacket and thrust him before her up the staircase, so
      quickly that the boy had no chance to speak, until she released her hold
      at the entrance to Uncle John's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of being taken prisoner in such a manner, and by a woman, too,
      was too much for the lad's endurance. "Let me go!" he cried, the instant
      he could recover his breath. "I won't hide away in your garret, like a
      woman, I won't. I want to see the militia and the minute men fight the
      troops, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help me first, Joe. Here, quick now; let's get this box out and up
      garret. We'll hide it under the corn and it'll be safe," she coaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The box was under Uncle John's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in the old thing any how?" questioned Joe, pulling with all his
      strength at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The box, or chest, was painted red, and was bound about by massive iron
      bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never seen the inside of it," said Mother Moulton. "It holds the
      poor old soul's sole treasure, and I DO want to save it for him if I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had drawn it with much hard endeavor, as far as the garret stairs,
      but their united strength failed to lift it. "Heave it, now!" cried Joe,
      and lo! it was up two steps. So they turned it over and over with many a
      thudding thump; every one of which thumps Uncle John heard, and believed
      to be strokes upon the box itself to burst it asunder, until it was fairly
      shelved on the garret floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very midst of the overturnings, a voice from below had been heard
      crying out, "Let my box alone! Don't break it open. If you do, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"
      but, whatever the poor man MEANT to threaten as a penalty, he could not
      think of anything half severe enough to say and so left it uncertain as to
      the punishment that might be looked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old soul!" ejaculated the little woman, her soft white curls in
      disorder and the pink color rising from her cheeks to her fair forehead,
      as she bent to help Joe drag the box beneath the rafter's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Joe," she said, "we'll heap nubbins over it, and if the soldiers
      want corn they'll take good ears and never think of touching poor
      nubbins"; so they fell to work throwing corn over the red chest, until it
      was completely concealed from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sprang to the high-up-window ledge in the point of the roof and
      took one glance out. "Oh, I see them, the Red-coats. True's I live, there
      go the militia UP THE HILL. I thought they was going to stand and defend.
      Shame on 'em, I say." Jumping down and crying back to Mother Moulton, "I'm
      going to stand by the minute men," he went down, three steps at a leap,
      and nearly overturned Uncle John on the stairs, who, with many groans was
      trying to get to the defense of his strong box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you help her for, you scamp," he demanded of Joe, flourishing
      his staff unpleasantly near the lad's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cause she asked me to, and couldn't do it alone," returned Joe, dodging
      the stick and disappearing from the scene, at the very moment Martha
      Moulton encountered Uncle John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your strong box is safe under nubbins in the garret, unless the house
      burns down, and now that you are up here, you had better stay," she added
      soothingly, as she hastened by him to reach the kitchen below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once there, she paused a second or two to take resolution regarding her
      next act. She knew full well that there was not one second to spare, and
      yet she stood looking, apparently, into the glowing embers on the hearth.
      She was flushed and excited, both by the unwonted toil, and the coming
      events. Cobwebs from the rafters had fallen on her hair and home-spun
      dress, and would readily have betrayed her late occupation, to any
      discerning soldier of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile broke suddenly over her face, displacing for a brief second every
      trace of care. "It's my only weapon, and I must use it," she said, making
      a stately courtesy to an imaginary guest and straightway disappeared
      within an adjoining room. With buttoned door and dropped curtains the
      little woman made haste to array herself in her finest raiment. In five
      minutes she reappeared in the kitchen, a picture pleasant to look at. In
      all New England, there could not be a more beautiful little old lady than
      Martha Moulton was that day. Her hair was guiltless now of cobwebs, but
      haloed her face with fluffy little curls of silvery whiteness, above
      which, like a crown, was a little cap of dotted muslin, pure as snow. Her
      erect figure, not a particle of the hard-working-day in it now, carried
      well the folds of a sheeny, black silk gown, over which she had tied an
      apron as spotless as the cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she fastened back her gown and hurried away the signs of the breakfast
      she had not eaten, the clear pink tints seemed to come out with added
      beauty of coloring in her cheeks; while her hair seemed fairer and whiter
      than at any moment in her three-score and eleven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Joe Devins looked in. As he caught a glimpse of the picture she
      made, he paused to cry out: "All dressed up to meet the robbers! My, how
      fine you do look! I wouldn't. I'd go and hide behind the nubbins. They'll
      be here in less than five minutes now," he cried, "and I'm going over the
      North Bridge to see what's going on there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Joe, stay, won't you?" she urged, but the lad was gone, and she was
      left alone to meet the foe, comforting herself with the thought, "They'll
      treat me with more respect if I LOOK respectable, and if I must die, I'll
      die good-looking in my best clothes, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw a few sticks of hickory-wood on the embers, and then drew out
      the little round stand, on which the family Bible was always lying.
      Recollecting that the British soldiers probably belonged to the Church of
      England, she hurried away to fetch Uncle John's "prayer-book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll have respect to me, if they find me reading that, I know," she
      thought. Having drawn the round stand within sight of the well, and where
      she could also command a view of the staircase, she sat and waited for
      coming events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle John was keeping watch of the advancing troops from an upper window.
      "Martha," he called, "you'd better come up. They're close by, now." To
      tell the truth, Uncle John himself was a little afraid; that is to say he
      hadn't quite courage enough to go down, and, perhaps, encounter his own
      rheumatism and the king's soldiers on the same stairway, and yet, he felt
      that he must defend Martha as well as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rap of a musket, quick and ringing on the front door, startled the
      little woman from her apparent devotions. She did not move at the call of
      anything so profane. It was the custom of the time to have the front door
      divided into two parts, the lower half and the upper half. The former was
      closed and made fast, the upper could be swung open at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier getting no reply, and doubtless thinking that the house was
      deserted, leaped over the chained lower half of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the clang of his bayonet against the brass trimmings, Martha Moulton
      groaned in spirit, for, if there was any one thing that she deemed
      essential to her comfort in this life, it was to keep spotless, speckless
      and in every way unharmed, the great knocker on her front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, sound English metal, too," she thought, "that an English soldier
      ought to know how to respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she heard the tramp of coming feet she only bent the closer over the
      Book of Prayer that lay open on her knee. Not one word did she read or
      see; she was inwardly trembling and outwardly watching the well and the
      staircase. But now, above all other sounds, broke the noise of Uncle
      John's staff thrashing the upper step of the staircase, and the shrill
      tremulous cry of the old man defiant, doing his utmost for the defense of
      his castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fingers that lay beneath the book tingled with desire to box the old
      man's ears, for the policy he was pursuing would be fatal to the treasure
      in garret and in well; but she was forced to silence and inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the King's troops, Major Pitcairn at their head, reached the open door
      and saw the old lady, they paused. What could they do but look, for a
      moment, at the unexpected sight that met their view; a placid old lady in
      black silk and dotted muslin, with all the sweet solemnity of morning
      devotion hovering about the tidy apartment and seeming to centre at the
      round stand by which she sat, this pretty woman, with pink and white face
      surmounted with fleecy little curls and crinkles and wisps of floating
      whiteness, who looked up to meet their gaze with such innocent
      prayer-suffused eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mother," said Major Pitcairn, raising his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, gentlemen and soldiers," returned Martha Moulton. "You will
      pardon my not meeting you at the door, when you see that I was occupied in
      rendering service to the Lord of all." She reverently closed the book,
      laid it on the table, and arose, with a stately bearing, to demand their
      wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're hungry, good woman," spoke the commander, "and your hearth is the
      only hospitable one we've seen since we left Boston. With your good leave
      I'll take a bit of this, and he stooped to lift up the Johnny-cake that
      had been all this while on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had something better to offer you," she said, making haste to
      fetch plates and knives from the corner-cupboard, and all the while she
      was keeping eye-guard over the well. "I'm afraid the Concorders haven't
      left much for you to-day," she added, with a soft sigh of regret, as
      though she really felt sorry that such brave men and good soldiers had
      fallen on hard times in the ancient town. At the moment she had brought
      forth bread and baked beans, and was putting them on the table, a voice
      rang into the room, causing every eye to turn toward Uncle John. He had
      gotten down the stairs without uttering one audible groan, and was
      standing, one step above the floor of the room, brandishing and whirling
      his staff about in a manner to cause even rheumatism to flee the place,
      while, at the top of his voice he cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Martha Moulton, how DARE you FEED these&mdash;these&mdash;monsters&mdash;in
      human form!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mind him, gentlemen, please don't," she made haste to say, "he's
      old, VERY old; eighty-five, his last birthday, and&mdash;a little
      hoity-toity at times," pointing deftly with her finger in the region of
      the reasoning powers in her own shapely head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning Major Pitcairn by an offer of a dish of beans, she contrived to
      say, under covert of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, sir, I couldn't go away and leave him; he is almost distracted
      with rheumatism, and this excitement to-day will kill him, I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing toward the staircase with bold and soldierly front, Major
      Pitcairn said to Uncle John:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand aside, old man, and we'll hold you harmless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe you will, you red-trimmed trooper, you," was the reply;
      and, with a dexterous swing of the wooden staff, he mowed off and down
      three military hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before any one had time to speak, Martha Moulton adroitly stooping, as
      though to recover Major Pitcairn's hat, which had rolled to her feet,
      swung the stairway-door into its place with a resounding bang, and
      followed up that achievement with a swift turn of two large wooden
      buttons, one high up, and the other low down, near the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" she said, "he is safe out of mischief for awhile, and your heads
      are safe as well. Pardon a poor old man, who does not know what he is
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems to know remarkably well," exclaimed an officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, behind the strong door, Uncle John's wrath knew no bounds. In
      his frantic endeavors to burst the fastenings of the wooden buttons,
      rheumatic cramps seized him and carried the day, leaving him out of the
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a portion of the soldiery clustered about the door. The king's
      horses were fed within five feet of the great brass knocker, while, within
      the house, the beautiful little old woman, in her Sunday-best-raiment,
      tried to do the dismal honors of the day to the foes of her country.
      Watching her, one would have thought she was entertaining heroes returned
      from the achievement of valiant deeds, whereas, in her own heart, she knew
      full well that she was giving a little to save much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could exceed the seeming alacrity with which she fetched water
      from the well for the officers: and, when Major Pitcairn gallantly ordered
      his men to do the service, the little soul was in alarm; she was so afraid
      that "somehow, in some way or another, the blue stocking would get hitched
      on to the bucket." She knew that she must to its rescue, and so she
      bravely acknowledged herself to have taken a vow (when, she did not say),
      to draw all the water that was taken from that well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A remnant of witchcraft!" remarked a soldier within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look like a witch?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do," replied Major Pitcairn, "I admire New England witches, and
      never would condemn one to be hung, or burned, or&mdash;smothered."
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha Moulton never wore so brilliant a color on her aged cheeks as at
      that moment. She felt bitter shame at the ruse she had attempted, but
      silver spoons were precious, and, to escape the smile that went around at
      Major Pitcairn's words, she was only too glad to go again to the well and
      dip slowly the high, over-hanging sweep into the cool, clear, dark depth
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the cold, frosty morning spent itself into the brilliant,
      shining noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know what happened at Concord on that 19th of April in the year 1775.
      You have been told the story, how the men of Acton met and resisted the
      king's troops at the old North Bridge, how brave Captain Davis and
      minute-man Hosmer fell, how the sound of their falling struck down to the
      very heart of mother earth, and caused her to send forth her brave sons to
      cry "Liberty, or Death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the rest of the story; the sixty or more barrels of flour that the
      king's troops found and struck the heads from, leaving the flour in
      condition to be gathered again at nightfall, the arms and powder that they
      destroyed, the houses they burned; all these, are they not recorded in
      every child's history in the land?
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were going on, for a brief while, at mid-day, Martha
      Moulton found her home deserted. She had not forgotten poor, suffering,
      irate Uncle John in the regions above, and, so, the very minute she had
      the chance, she made a strong cup of catnip tea (the real tea, you know,
      was brewing in Boston harbor).
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned the buttons, and, with a bit of trembling at her heart, such as
      she had not felt all day, she ventured up the stairs, bearing the steaming
      peace-offering before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle John was writhing under the sharp thorns and twinges of his old
      enemy, and in no frame of mind to receive any overtures in the shape of
      catnip tea; nevertheless, he was watching, as well as he was able, the
      motions of the enemy. As she drew near he cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out this window, and see! Much GOOD all your scheming will do YOU!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed his command to look, and the sight she then saw caused her to
      let fall the cup of catnip tea and rush down the stairs, wringing her
      hands as she went and crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear! what shall I do? The house will burn and the box up garret.
      Everything's lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Pitcairn, at that moment, was on the green in front of her door,
      giving orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting the dignified part she intended to play, forgetting everything
      but the supreme danger that was hovering in mid-air over her home&mdash;the
      old house wherein she had been born, and the only home she had ever known&mdash;she
      rushed out upon the green, amid the troops, and surrounded by cavalry, and
      made her way to Major Pitcairn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The town-house is on fire!" she cried, laying her hand upon the
      commander's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked at her. Major Pitcairn had recently learned that the
      task he had been set to do in the provincial towns that day was not an
      easy one; that, when hard pressed and trodden down, the despised rustics,
      in home-spun dress, could sting even English soldiers; and thus it
      happened that, when he felt the touch of Mother Moulton's plump little old
      fingers on his military sleeve, he was not in the pleasant humor that he
      had been, when the same hand had ministered to his hunger in the early
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what of it? LET IT BURN! We won't hurt you, if you go in the house
      and stay there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and glanced up at the court-house. Already flames were issuing
      from it. "Go in the house and let it burn, INDEED!" thought she. "He knows
      me, don't he? Oh, sir! for the love of Heaven won't you stop it?" she
      said, entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run in the house, good mother. That is a wise woman," he advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in her heart, and as the very outcome of lip and brain she wanted to
      say, "You needn't 'mother' me, you murderous rascal!" but, remembering
      everything that was at stake, she crushed her wrath and buttoned it in as
      closely as she had Uncle John behind the door in the morning, and again,
      with swift gentleness, laid her hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and looked at her. Vexed at her persistence, and extremely
      annoyed at intelligence that had just reached him from the North Bridge,
      he said, imperiously, "Get away! or you'll be trodden down by the horses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I CAN'T go!" she cried, clasping his arm, and fairly clinging to it in
      her frenzy of excitement. "Oh stop the fire, quick, quick! or my house
      will burn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no time to put out your fires," he said, carelessly, shaking loose
      from her hold and turning to meet a messenger with news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little woman! What could she do? The wind was rising, and the fire
      grew. Flame was creeping out in a little blue curl in a new place, under
      the rafter's edge, AND NOBODY CARED. That was what increased the pressing
      misery of it all. It was so unlike a common country alarm, where everybody
      rushed up and down the streets, crying "Fire! fire! f-i-r-e!" and went
      hurrying to and fro for pails of water to help put it out. Until that
      moment the little woman did not know how utterly deserted she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In very despair, she ran to her house, seized two pails, filled them with
      greater haste than she had ever drawn water before, and, regardless of
      Uncle John's imprecations, carried them forth, one in either hand, the
      water dripping carelessly down the side breadths of her fair silk gown,
      her silvery curls tossed and tumbled in white confusion, her pleasant face
      aflame with eagerness, and her clear eyes suffused with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus equipped with facts and feeling, she once more appeared to Major
      Pitcairn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a mother in old England?" she cried. "If so, for her sake, stop
      this fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her words touched his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I do&mdash;?" he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "THEN YOUR JOHNNY-CAKE ON MY HEARTH WON'T BURN UP," she said, with a quick
      little smile, adjusting her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Pitcairn laughed, and two soldiers, at his command, seized the pails
      and made haste to the court-house, followed by many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For awhile the fire seemed victorious, but, by brave effort, it was
      finally overcome, and the court-house saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a distance Joe Devins had noticed the smoke hovering like a little
      cloud, then sailing away still more like a cloud over the town; and he had
      made haste to the scene, arriving in time to venture on the roof, and do
      good service there.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the fire was extinguished, he thought of Martha Moulton, and he
      could not help feeling a bit guilty at the consciousness that he had gone
      off and left her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to the house he found her entertaining the king's troopers with the
      best food her humble store afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so charmed with herself, and so utterly well pleased with the
      success of her pleading, that the little woman's nerves fairly quivered
      with jubilation; and best of all, the blue stocking was still safe in the
      well, for had she not watched with her own eyes every time the bucket was
      dipped to fetch up water for the fire, having, somehow, got rid of the vow
      she had taken regarding the drawing of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she saw the lad looking, with surprised countenance, into the room
      where the feast was going on, a fear crept up her own face and darted out
      from her eyes. It was, lest Joe Devins should spoil it all by ill-timed
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made haste to meet him, basket in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Joe," she said, "fetch me some small wood, there's a good boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she gave him the basket she was just in time to stop the rejoinder that
      was issuing from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time to intercept his return she was at the wood-pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joe," she said, half-abashed before the truth that shone in the boy's
      eyes, "Joe," she repeated, "you know Major Pitcairn ordered the fire put
      out, TO PLEASE ME, because I begged him so, and, in return, what CAN I do
      but give them something to eat. Come and help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't," responded Joe. "Their hands are red with blood. They've killed
      two men at the bridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's killed?" she asked, trembling, but Joe would not tell her. He
      demanded to know what had been done with Uncle John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's quiet enough, up-stairs," she replied, with a sudden spasm of
      feeling that she HAD neglected Uncle John shamefully; still, with the day,
      and the fire and everything, how could she help it? but, really, it did
      seem strange that he made no noise, with a hundred armed men coming and
      going through the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least, that was what Joe thought, and, having deposited the basket of
      wood on the threshold of the kitchen door, he departed around the corner
      of the house. Presently he had climbed a pear-tree, dropped from one of
      its overhanging branches on the lean-to, raised a sash and crept into the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping off his shoes, heavy with spring-mud, he proceeded to search for
      Uncle John. He was not in his own room; he was not in the guest-chamber;
      he was not in any one of the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor, by the window in the hall, looking out upon the green, he
      found the broken cup and saucer that Martha Moulton had let fall. Having
      made a second round, in which he investigated every closet and penetrated
      into the spaces under beds, Joe thought of the garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tramp, tramp went the heavy feet on the sanded floors below, drowning
      every possible sound from above; nevertheless, as the lad opened the door
      leading into the garret, he whispered cautiously: "Uncle John! Uncle
      John!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All was silent above. Joe went up, and was startled by a groan. He had to
      stand a few seconds, to let the darkness grow into light, ere he could
      see; and, when he could discern outlines in the dimness, there was given
      to him the picture of Uncle John, lying helpless amid and upon the nubbins
      that had been piled over his strong box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Uncle John, are you dead?" asked Joe, climbing over to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the house afire?" was the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      "House afire? No! The confounded red-coats up and put it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought they was going to let me burn to death up here!" groaned Uncle
      John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I help you up?" and Joe proffered two strong hands, rather black with
      toil and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! You can't help me. If the house isn't afire, I'll stand it till
      the fellows are gone, and then, Joe you fetch the doctor as quick as you
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "YOU can't get a doctor for love nor money this night, Uncle John. There's
      too much work to be done in Lexington and Concord to-night for wounded and
      dying men; and there'll be more of 'em too afore a single red-coat sees
      Boston again. They'll be hunted down every step of the way. They've killed
      Captain Davis, from Acton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they have, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Joe Devins, go down and do-do something. There's my niece,
      a-feeding the murderers! I'll disown her. She shan't have a penny of my
      pounds, she shan't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Joe and Uncle John were compelled to remain in inaction, while below,
      the weary little woman acted the kind hostess to His Majesty's troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the feast was spent, and the soldiers were summoned to begin their
      painful march. Assembled on the green, all was ready, when Major Pitcairn,
      remembering the little woman who had ministered to his wants, returned to
      the house to say farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twas but a step to her door, and but a moment since he had left it, but
      he found her crying; crying with joy, in the very chair where he had found
      her at prayers in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would like to say good-by," he said; "you've been very kind to me
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick dash or two of the dotted white apron (spotless no longer) to
      her eye, she arose. Major Pitcairn extended his hand, but she folded her
      own closely together, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you a pleasant journey back to Boston, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not shake hands with me before I go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can feed the enemy of my country, but shake hands with him, NEVER!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time that day, the little woman's love of country seemed to
      rise triumphant within her, and drown every impulse to selfishness; or was
      it the nearness to safety that she felt? Human conduct is the result of so
      many motives that it is sometimes impossible to name the compound,
      although on that occasion Martha Moulton labelled it "Patriotism."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet I put out the fire for you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your mother's sake, in old England, it was, you remember, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember," said Major Pitcairn, with a sigh, as he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for HER sake I will shake hands with you," said Martha Moulton.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he turned back, and across the threshold, in presence of the waiting
      troops, the commander of the expedition to Concord, and the only woman in
      the town, shook hands at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha Moulton saw Major Pitcairn mount his horse; heard the order given
      for the march to begin,&mdash;the march of which you all have heard. You
      know what a sorry time the Red-coats had of it in getting back to Boston;
      how they were fought at every inch of the way, and waylaid from behind
      every convenient tree-trunk, and shot at from tree-tops, and aimed at from
      upper windows, and beseiged from behind stone walls, and, in short, made
      so miserable and harassed and overworn, that at last their depleted ranks,
      with the tongues of the men parched and hanging, were fain to lie down by
      the road-side and take what came next, even though it might be death. And
      then THE DEAD they left behind them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! there's nothing wholesome to mind or body about war, until long, long
      after it is over, and the earth has had time to hide the blood, and send
      it forth in sweet blooms of liberty, with forget-me-nots springing thick
      between.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of that day are long dead. The same soil holds regulars and
      minute-men. England, who over-ruled, and the provinces, that put out brave
      hands to seize their rights, are good friends to-day, and have shaken
      hands over many a threshold of hearty thought and kind deeds since that
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree of Liberty grows yet, stately and fair, for the men of the
      Revolution planted it well and surely. God himself HATH given it increase.
      So we gather to-day, in this our story, a forget-me-not more, from the old
      town of Concord.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the troops had marched away, the weary little woman laid aside her
      silken gown, resumed her homespun dress, and immediately began to think of
      getting Uncle John down-stairs again into his easy chair; but it required
      more aid than she could give to lift the fallen man. At last Joe Devins
      summoned returning neighbors, who came to the rescue, and the poor nubbins
      were left to the rats once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe climbed down the well and rescued the blue stocking, with its
      treasures unharmed, even to the precious watch, which watch was Martha
      Moulton's chief treasure, and one of very few in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha Moulton was the heroine of the day. The house was beseiged by
      admiring men and women that night and for two or three days thereafter;
      but when, years later, she being older, and poorer, even to want,
      petitioned the General Court for a reward for the service she rendered in
      persuading Major Pitcairn to save the court-house from burning, there was
      granted to her only fifteen dollars, a poor little forget-me-not, it is
      true, but JUST ENOUGH to carry her story down the years, whereas, but for
      that, it might never have been wafted up and down the land.
    </p>

   Sweep, sweep, sweep!  Up all this dirt and dust,

    <h2>
      THE CONQUEST OF FAIRYLAND.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    There reigned a king in the land of Persia, mighty and
   great was he grown,
   On the necks of the kings of the conquered earth he builded up
   his throne.

    There sate a king on the throne of Persia; and he was grown so
     proud
   That all the life of the world was less to him than a passing
   cloud.

    He reigned in glory: joy and sorrow lying between his hands.
   If he sighed a nation shook, his smile ripened the harvest of
   lands.

    He was the saddest man beneath the everlasting sky,
   For all his glories had left him old, and the proudest king must
      die.

    He who was even as God to all the nations of men,
   Must die as the merest peasant dies, and turn into earth again.

    And his life with the fear of death was bitter and sick and
   accursed,
   As brackish water to drink of which is to be forever athirst.

    The hateful years rolled on and on, but once it chanced at noon
   The drowsy court was thrilled to gladness, it echoed so sweet a
     tune.

    Low as the lapping of tile sea, as the song of the lark is
   clear,  Wild as the moaning of pine branches; the king was fain
   to hear.

    "What is the song, and who is the singer?" he said; "before
   the throne
   Let him come, for the songs of the world are mine, and all but
    this are known."

    Seven mighty kings went out the minstrel man to find:
   And all they found was a dead cyprus soughing in the wind.

    And slower still, and sadder still the heavy winters rolled,
   And the burning summers waned away, and the king grew very
   old;

    Dull, worn, feeble, bent; and once he thought, "to die
   Were rest, at least." And as he thought the music wandered by.

    Into the presence of the king, singing, the singer came,
   And his face was like the spring in flower, his eyes were clear
      as flame.

    "What is the song you play, and what the theme your praises
   sing?
   It is sweet; I knew not I owned a thing so sweet," said the weary
       king.

    "I sing my country," said the singer, "a land that is sweeter
   than song."
   "Which of my kingdoms is your country?  Thither would I along."

    "Great, O king, is thy power, and the earth a footstool for thy
      feet;
     But my country is free, and my own country, and oh, my country
      is sweet!"

    As he heard the eyes of the king grew young and alive with fire
   "Lo, is there left on the earth a thing to strive for, a thing to
       desire?

    "Where is thy country?  tell me, O singer, speak thine innermost
       heart!
   Leave thy music!  speak plainly!  Speak-forget thine art!"

    The eyes of the singer shone as he sang, and his voice rang wild
       and free
   As the elemental wind or the uncontrollable sobs of the sea.

    "O my distant home!" he sighed; "Oh, alas!  away and afar
   I watch thee now as a lost sailor watches a shining star.

    "Oh, that a wind would take me there!  that a bird would set me
      down
   Where the golden streets shine red at sunset in my father's town!

    "For only in dreams I see the faces of the women there,
   And fain would I hear them singing once, braiding their ropes
   of hair.

    "Oh, I am thirsty, and long to drink of the river of Life, and I
   Am fain to find my own country, where no man shall die."

    Out of the light of the throne the king looked down: as in the
     spring
   The green leaves burst from their dusky buds, so was hope in the
      eyes of the king.

    "Lo," he said, "I will make thee great; I will make thee mighty
      in sway
   Even as I; but the name of thy country speak, and the place and
     the way."

    "Oh, the way to my country is ever north till you pass the mouth
       of hell,
   Past the limbo of dreams and the desolate land where shadows
   dwell.

    "And when you have reached the fount of wonder, you ford the
   waters wan
   To the land of elves and the land of fairies, enchanted
   Masinderan."

    The singer ceased; and the lyre in his hand snapped, as a cord,
      in twain;
   And neither lyre nor singer was seen in the kingdom of Persia
   again.

    And all the nobles gazed astounded; no man spoke a word
   Till the old king said: "Call out my armies; bring me hither a
    sword!"

    As a little torrent swollen by snows is turned to a terrible
   stream,
   So the gathering voices of all his countries cried to the king in
       his dream.

    Crying, "For thee, O our king, for thee we had freely and
   willingly died,
   Warriors, martyrs, what thou wilt; not that our lives betide

   "The worth of a thought to the king, but rather because thy rod
   Is over our heads as over thine Is the changeless will of God.

    "Rather for this we beseech thee, O master, for thine own sake
     refrain
   From the blasphemous madness of pride, from the fever of
   impious gain."

    "You seek my death," the king thundered; "you cry, forbear
   to save
   The life of a king too old to frolic; let him sleep in the grave.

    "But I will live for all your treason; and, by my own right
   hand!
   I will set out this day with you to conquer Fairyland."

    Then all the nations paled aghast, for the battle to begin
    Was a war with God, and a war with death, and they knew
         the thing was sin.

    Sick at heart they gathered together, but none denounced the
   wrong,
   For the will of God was unseen, unsaid, and the will of the king
      was strong.

    So the air grew bright with spears, and the earth shook under
   the tread
   Of the mighty horses harnessed for battle; the standards flaunted
       red.

    And the wind was loud with the blare of trumpets, and every
   house was void
   Of the strength and stay of the house, and the peace of the land
      destroyed.

    And the growing corn was trodden under the weight of armed
   feet,
   And every woman in Persia cursed the sound of a song too sweet,

    Cursed the insensate longing for life in the heart of a sick old
       man;
   But the king of Persia with all his armies marched on Masinderan.

    Many a day they marched in the sun till their silver armour was
      lead
   To sink their bodies into the grave, and many a man fell dead.

    And they passed the mouth of hell, and the shadowy country
   gray,
   Where the air is mist and the people mist and the rain more
   real than they.

    And they came to the fount of wonder, and forded the waters
   wan,
   And the king of Persia and all his armies marched on Masinderan.

    And they turned the rivers to blood, and the fields to a ravaged
       camp,
   And they neared the golden faery town, that burned in the dusk
    as a lamp.

    And they stood and shouted for joy to see it stand so nigh,
   Given into their hands for spoil; and their hearts beat proud
   and high.

    And the armies longed for the morrow, to conquer the shining
   town,
   For there was no death in the land, neither any to strike them
    down.

    The hosts were many in numbers, mighty, and skilled in the
   strife,
   And they lusted for gold and conquest as the old king lusted for
      life.

    And, gazing on the golden place, night took them unaware,
     And black and windy grew the skies, and black the eddying air

    So long the night and black the night that fell upon their eyes,
   They quaked with fear, those mighty hosts; the sun would never
    rise.

    Darkness and deafening sounds confused the black, tempestuous
    air,
     And no man saw his neighbor's face, nor heard his neighbor's
    prayer.

    And wild with terror the raging armies fell on each other in
   fight,
   The ground was strewn with wounded men, mad in the horrible night

    Mad with eternal pain, with darkness and stabbing blows
    Rained on all sides from invisible hands till the ground was red
       as a rose.

    And, though he was longing for rest, none ventured to pause from
       the strife,
    Lest haply another wound be his to poison his hateful life

    And the king entreated death; and for peace the armies prayed;
   But the gifts of God are everlasting, his word is not gainsaid;

    Gold and battle are given the hosts, their boon is turned to a
   ban,
     And the curse of the king is to reign forever in conquered
   Masinderan.

    <h2>
      KENTUCKY BELLE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away&mdash;
     Gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay&mdash;
     We lived in the log-house yonder, poor as ever you've seen;
   Roschen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.

    Conrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle;
     How much we thought of Kentucky, I couldn't begin to tell&mdash;
     Came from the Blue-Grass country; my father gave her to me
     When I rode north with Conrad, away from Tennessee.

    Conrad lived in Ohio&mdash;a German he is, you know&mdash;
   The house stood in broad corn-fields, stretching on, row after
   row;
   The old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be
   But I kept longing, longing, for the hills of Tennessee.

    O, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!
     Clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that is never still
     But the level land went stretching away to meet the sky&mdash;
     Never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!

    From east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,
   Nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon;
     Only the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn;
     Only the "rustle, rustle," as I walked among the corn.

    When I fell sick with pining, we didn't wait any more,
     But moved away from the corn-lands out to this river shore&mdash;
     The Tuscarawas it's called, sir&mdash;off there's a hill, you see&mdash;
     And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.

    I was at work that morning.  Some one came riding like mad
   Over the bridge and up the road&mdash;Farmer Rouf's little lad;
   Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say;
   "Morgan's men are coming, Frau; they're galloping on this way;

    "I'm sent to warn the neighbors.  He isn't a mile behind;
   He sweeps up all the horses&mdash;every horse that he can find;
   Morgan, Morgan, the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,
   With bowie-knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen."

    The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;
   The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;
   Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone;
   Nearer, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!

    Sudden I picked up the baby, and ran to the pasture-bar;
   "Kentuck!" I called; "Kentucky!" She knew me ever so far!
   I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,
   And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.

    As I ran back to the log-house, at once there came a sound&mdash;
   The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground&mdash;
   Coming into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen&mdash;
     Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men.

    As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm!
   But still I stood in the doorway, with baby on my arm.
   They came; they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped
   along&mdash;
   Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band six hundred strong.

    Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through
    day;
   Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,
   To the border-strip where Virginia runs up into the West,
   To ford the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.

    On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;
   Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways
    glance;
   And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,
   When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.

    Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,
   As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place:
   I gave him a cup, and he smiled&mdash;'twas only a boy, you see;
   Faint and worn; with dim blue eyes, and he'd sailed on the
   Tennessee.

    Only sixteen he was, sir&mdash;a fond mother's only son&mdash;
   Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!
   The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish
   mouth;
   And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South!

    O, pluck was he to the backbone; and clear grit through and
   through;
   Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't
   do;
   The boy was dying sir, dying, as plain as plain could be,
   Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.

    But, when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,
   Water came into his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth;
    "Do you know the Blue-Grass country?" he wistfully began to say;
   Then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away.

    I had him into the log-house, and worked and brought him to;
   I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;
   And, when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,
   Morgan's men were miles away, galloping, galloping on.

    "O, I must go," he muttered; "I must be up and away!
   Morgan, Morgan is waiting for me!  O, what will Morgan say?"
   But I heard the sound of tramping, and kept him back from the
   door&mdash;
   The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard before.

    And on, on came the soldiers&mdash;the Michigan cavalry&mdash;
   And fast they rode, and back they looked, galloping rapidly;
   They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day
   and night;
   But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.

    And rich Ohio sat startled through all these summer days;
   For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways;
   Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east,
   now west,
   Through river-valleys and corn-land farms, sweeping away her
   best.

    A bold ride and a long ride!  But they were taken at last;
   They had almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;
   But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the
   ford,
   And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.

    Well, I kept the boy till evening&mdash;kept him against his will&mdash;
   But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still;
   When it was cool and dusky&mdash;you'll wonder to hear me tell&mdash;
   But I stole down to the gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle.

    I kissed the star on her forehead&mdash;my pretty, gentle lass&mdash;
   But I knew that she'd be happy, back in the old Blue-Grass:
   A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,
   And Kentucky, pretty Kentucky, I gave to the worn-out lad.

    I guided him to the southward, as well as I knew how:
   The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;
   And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell;
   And down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!

     When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high,
   Baby and I were both crying&mdash;I couldn't tell him why&mdash;
   But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,
   And a thin old horse with drooping head stood in Kentucky's
   stall.

    Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me,
   He knew I couldn't help it&mdash;'twas all for the Tennessee;
   But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass&mdash;
   A letter, sir, and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass.

     The lad got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;
   And Kentuck she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;
   He cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or
   spur;
   Ah!  we've had many horses, but never a horse like her!

    <h2>
      WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was seven years old, lived in Cheyenne, and his name was Tommy.
      Moreover he was going to school for the first time in his life. Out here
      little people are not allowed to attend school when they are five or six,
      for the Law says: "Children under seven must not go to school."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Tommy was seven and had been to school two weeks, and such
      delightful weeks! Every day mamma listened to long accounts of how "me and
      Dick Ray played marbles," and "us fellers cracked the whip." There was
      another thing that he used to tell mamma about, something that in those
      first days he always spoke of in the most subdued tones, and that&mdash;I
      am sorry to record it of any school, much more a Cheyenne school&mdash;was
      the numerous whippings that were administered to various little boys and
      girls. There was something painfully fascinating about those whippings to
      restless, mischievous little Tommy who had never learned the art of
      sitting still. He knew his turn might come at any moment and one night he
      cried out in his sleep: "Oh, dear, what will become of me if I get
      whipped!" But as the days passed on and this possible retribution overtook
      him not, his fears gradually forsook him, and instead of speaking
      pitifully of "those poor little children who were whipped," he mentioned
      them in a causal off-hand manner as, "those cry-babies, you know?" One
      afternoon mamma saw him sitting on the porch, slapping his little fat hand
      with a strap. "Tommy, child, what in the world are you doing?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into his pocket he thrust the strap, and the pink cheeks grew pinker still
      as their owner answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;was just seeing&mdash;how hard I could hit my hand&mdash;without
      crying;" and he disappeared around the side of the house before mamma
      could ask any more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Tommy's seatmate, Dicky Ray, was naughty in school, and Miss
      Linnet called him up, opened her desk, took out a little riding whip&mdash;it
      was a bright blue one&mdash;and then and there administered punishment.
      And because he cried, when recess came, Tommy said: "Isn't Dick Ray just a
      reg'lar girl cry-baby?" (He had learned that word from some of the big
      boys, but, mind you! he never dared to say it before his mother.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick's face flushed with anger. "Never you mind, Tommy Brown," said he,
      "Just wait till you get whipped and we'll see a truly girl-cry-baby then,
      won't we, Daisy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And blue-eyed Daisy, who was the idol of their hearts, nodded her curly
      little head in the most emphatic manner, and said she "wouldn't be one bit
      s'prised if he'd holler so loud that hey would hear him way down in
      Colorado."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy stood aghast! for, really and truly, he wasn't quite so
      stony-hearted a little mortal as he appeared to be; he had been secretly
      rather sorry for Dick, but&mdash;he wanted Daisy to think that he himself
      was big and manly, and he had the opinion that this was just the way to
      win her admiration. But all this time HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT DAISY DID&mdash;that
      Dick's pockets were full of sugar-plums; tiptop ones too, for Daisy had
      tasted them, and knew that little packets of them would from time to time
      find their way into her chubby hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of the morning Tommy kept thinking, thinking, thinking. One
      thing was certain: the present situation was not to be endured one moment
      longer than was absolutely necessary. But what could he do? Should he
      fight Dicky? This plan was rejected at once, on high, moral grounds. Well,
      then, supposing some dark night he should see Daisy on the street, just
      grab her, hold on tight and say: "Now, Daisy Rivers, I won't let you go
      till you promise you'll like me a great deal betterer than you do Dick
      Ray." There seemed something nice about this plan, very nice; the more
      Tommy thought of it, the better he liked it; only there were two
      objections to it. Firstly: Daisy never by any chance ventured out doors
      after dark. Secondly: Neither did Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both objections being insurmountable, this delightful scheme was
      reluctantly abandoned, and the thinking process went on harder than ever,
      till at last&mdash;oh, oh! if he only dared! What a triumph it would be!
      But then he couldn't&mdash;yes, he could too. Didn't she say that she
      "wouldn't be one bit s'prised if he hollered so loud that they would hear
      him way down in Colorado?" Colorado, indeed! He'd show her there was one
      boy in the school who wasn't a girl-cry-baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, actually, foolish Tommy had decided to prove his manhood by being
      whipped, and that that interesting little event should take place that
      very afternoon!
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he do? He whispered six times!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been any other child, he would surely have been punished; but Miss
      Linnet knew both Tommy and his mamma quite well, and therefore she knew
      also, quite well, that only a few days ago the one horror of Tommy's life
      had been the thought that he might possibly be whipped. Then too, it was
      his first term at school, and hitherto he had been very good. So she
      decided to keep him after school and talk to him of the sinfulness of bad
      conduct in general, and of whispering in particular. This plan she
      faithfully carried out, and the little culprit's heart so melted within
      him that he climbed up on his teacher's lap, put his arms around her neck
      and kissed her, crying he would never be so naughty again. He was just
      going to tell her all about Daisy, when in walked a friend of Miss
      Linnet's, so he went home instead. The next morning he started for school
      with the firm determination to be a good child, and I really believe he
      would have been had not that provoking little witch of a Daisy marched
      past him in a very independent manner, her saucy nose away up in the air,
      and a scornful look in the pretty blue eyes. It was more than flesh and
      blood could stand. All Tom's good resolutions flew sky-high.
    </p>
    <p>
      When twelve o'clock came Miss Linnet's list of delinquents begun in this
      wise:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   WHISPER MARKS.  Thomas Brown.....   15
                   Melinda Jones.....  11
</pre>
    <p>
      There was great excitement among the little people. How dared any one be
      so dreadfully bad! Tommy's heart sank, sank, sank, when Miss Linnet said:
      "When school begins this afternoon I shall punish Tommy and Melinda."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she did! She called them both up on the platform, made them clasp
      hands and stand with their backs against the blackboard, then wrote just
      above their heads:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Thomas Brown and              Partners in disgrace.
   Melinda Jones                 15 plus 11 = 26.
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh, how mortified and ashamed Tommy was! If only she had whipped him, or
      if it had been some other girl. But MELINDA JONES!!! At the end of ten
      minutes Miss Linnet let them take their seats; but Tommy's heart burned
      within him. DAISY HAD LAUGHED WHEN HE STOOD THERE HOLDING MELINDA'S HAND!
      There were deep crimson spots on Tommy's cheeks all that afternoon and a
      resolute, determined look in his bright brown eyes, but he was very still
      and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day the children were startled by a sudden commotion on the
      other side of the room. Daisy was writing on her slate and Melinda Jones,
      in passing to her seat, accidentally knocked it out of her hands; without
      a moment's hesitation, Daisy, by way of expressing her feelings, snatched
      her slate and promptly administered such a sounding "whack!" on Melinda's
      back and shoulders as brought a shriek of anguish from that poor, little
      unfortunate who began to think that if all the days of her life were to be
      like unto this day, existence would certainly prove a burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just about two minutes later Miss Linnet was standing by her desk, a ruler
      in one hand and Daisy's open palm in the other, while Daisy herself,
      miserable little culprit, stood white and trembling before her. As she
      raised the ruler to give the first blow, Tommy sprang forward, placing
      himself at Daisy's side, put his open palm over hers, and with tears in
      his eyes, pleaded in this wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, Miss Linnet, whip me instead! She is only just a little girl and
      I KNOW she'll cry, it will hurt her so! I'd rather it would be me every
      time than Daisy&mdash;truly I won't cry. Oh, please whip me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Linnet did whip him, while Daisy, filled with remorse, clung to
      him sobbing as if her heart would break. To be sure, somebody who ought to
      know, told me it was the lightest "feruling" ever child received; but
      Daisy and Tommy both assured their mothers that it was the "dreadfulest,
      cruelest, hardest whipping ever was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did my little man cry?" asked mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed! I stood up big as I could, looked at Daisy and smiled, 'cause
      I was so glad it wasn't her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then that proud and happy mamma took him in her arms and kissed him; and
      right in the midst of the kissing in walked Daisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would Tommy please come and take supper with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he would, and they walked off hand in hand. When they passed
      Dicky's house Tommy suggested. "S'posing they forgive Dick and let him go
      'long too." And Daisy agreeing, they called that young gentleman out and
      magnanimously informed him that he was forgiven and might come and have
      supper with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What in the world they had to forgive, nobody knows; but then, so long as
      forgiveness proved such an eminently satisfactory arrangement, all round&mdash;why,
      nobody need care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children waited outside the gate while Dick coaxed his mother to let
      him go, and standing there, hand in hand, Daisy plucked up heart of grace
      and with very rosy cheeks and an air about her of general penitence, said
      something very sweet in a very small voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry you were whipped, and oh, Tommy, I wish I hadn't said you'd
      holler!"

    <h2>
      "APPLES FINKEY"&mdash;THE WATER-BOY.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "Apples Finkey!" Many a name
  Has a grander sound in the roll of fame;

 Many a more resplendent deed
  Has burst to light in the hour of need;

 But never a one from a truer heart,
  Striving to know and to do its part.

 Striving, under his skin of tan,
  With the years of a lad to act like a man.

 And who was "Apples?" I hear you ask.
  To trace his descent were indeed a task.

 Winding and vague was the family road&mdash;
  And, perhaps, like Topsy, "he only growed."

 But into the camp he lolled one noon,
  Barefoot, and whistling a darky tune,

 Into the camp of his dusky peers&mdash;
  The gallant negro cavaliers&mdash;

 The Tenth, preparing, at break o' day,
  To move to the transport down in the bay.

 Boom!  roared the gun&mdash;the ship swung free,
  With her good prow turned to the Carib Sea.

 "Pity it was, for the little cuss,
  We couldn't take 'Apples' along with us,"

 The trooper said, as he walked the deck,
  And Tampa became a vanishing speck.

 What's that?   A stir and a creak down there
  In the piled-up freight&mdash;then a tuft of hair,

 Crinkled and woolly and unshorn&mdash;
  And out popped "Apples" "ez shore's yer born!"

 Of course he wasn't provided for
  In the colonel's roll or the rules of war;

 But somehow or other the troop was glad
  To welcome the little darky lad.

 You know how our brave men, white and black,
  Landed and followed the Spaniard's track;

 And the Tenth was there in the very front,
  Seeking and finding the battle's brunt.

 Onward they moved through the living hell
  Where the enemy's bullets like raindrops fell,

 Down through the brush, and onward still
  Till they came to the foot of San Juan hill&mdash;

 Then up they went, with never a fear,
  And the heights were won with a mad, wild cheer!

 And where was "the mascot Finkey" then?
  In the surging ranks of the fighting men!

 Wherever a trooper was seen to fall,
  In the open field or the chaparral;

 Wherever was found a wounded man;
  "Apples" was there with his water and can.

 About him the shrapnel burst in vain&mdash;
  He was up and on with his work again.

 The sharpshooters rattled a sharp tattoo,
  The singing mausers around him flew.

 But "Apples" was busy&mdash;too busy to care
  For the instant death and the danger there.

 Many a parched throat burning hot,
  Many a victim of Spanish shot,

 Was blessed that day; ere the fight was won
  Under the tropical, deadly sun,

 By the cool drops poured from the water-can
  Of the dusky lad who was all a man.

 In the forward trenches, at close of day,
  Burning with fever, "Finkey" lay.

 He seemed to think through the long, wet night,
  He still was out in the raging fight,

 For once he spoke in his troubled sleep;
  "I'se comin', Cap., ef my legs'll keep!"

 Next day&mdash;and the next&mdash;and the next&mdash;he stayed
  In the trenches dug by the Spaniard's spade,

 For the sick and wounded could not get back
  Over the mountainous, muddy track.

 But the troopers gave what they had to give
  That the little mascot might stick and live.

 Over him many a dark face bent,
  And through it all he was well content&mdash;

 Well content as a soldier should
  Who had fought his fight and the foe withstood.

 Slowly these stern beleaguered men
  Nursed him back to his strength again,

 Till one fair day his glad eyes saw
  A sight that filled him with pride and awe,

 For there, as he looked on the stronghold down,
  The flag was hoisted over the town,

 And none in that host felt a sweeter joy
  Than "Apples Finkey," the water-boy.
                &mdash;JOHN JEROME ROONEY, in New York Sun.

 Down at the pond in zero weather,
  To have a fine skate
           the girls and boys gather.
  Even the Baby thinks it a treat,
      But somehow cannot stay upon his feet.

      THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.

    <p>
      "I thought, Mr. Allen, when I gave my Bennie to his country, that not a
      father in all this broad land made so precious a gift&mdash;no, not one.
      The dear boy only slept a minute, just one little minute at his post; I
      know that was all, for Bennie never dozed over a duty. How prompt and
      reliable he was! I know he only fell asleep one little second&mdash;he was
      so young and not strong, that boy of mine. Why, he was as tall as I, and
      only eighteen! And now they shoot him because he was found asleep when
      doing sentinel duty. "Twenty-four hours," the telegram said, only
      twenty-fours hours. Where is Bennie now?"

      "Yes, yes; let us hope; God is very merciful! 'I should be ashamed,
      father,' Bennie said, 'when I am a man to think I never used this great
      right arm'&mdash;and he held it out proudly before me&mdash;'for my
      country when it needed it. Palsy it, rather than keep it at the plow.'
      'Go, then, my boy, and God keep you!' I said. God has kept him, I think,
      Mr. Allen!" And the farmer repeated these last words slowly, as if in
      spite of his reason his heart doubted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like the apple of the eye, Mr. Owen; doubt it not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom sat near them listening with blanched cheek. She had not shed a
      tear. Her anxiety had been so concealed that no one had noticed it. She
      had occupied herself mechanically in the household cares. Now, she
      answered a gentle tap at the door, opening it to receive from a neighbor's
      hand a letter. "It is from him," was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a message from the dead! Mr. Owen took the letter, but could
      not break the envelope on account of his trembling fingers, and held it
      toward Mr. Allen, with the helplessness of a child. The minister opened it
      and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Father:&mdash;When this reaches you I shall be in eternity. At first
      it seemed awful to me, but I have thought so much about it that now it has
      no terror. They say they will not bind me, nor blind me, but that I may
      meet death like a man. I thought, father, that it might have been on the
      battle field, for my country, and that when I fell, it would be fighting
      gloriously; but to be shot down like a dog for nearly betraying it&mdash;to
      die for neglect of duty! O, father! I wonder the very thought does not
      kill me! But I shall not disgrace you; I am going to write you all about
      it, and when I am gone you may tell my comrades. I cannot, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I promised Jemmie Carr's mother I would look after her boy; and
      when he fell sick I did all I could for him. He was not strong when he was
      ordered back into the ranks, and the day before that night, I carried all
      his luggage besides my own on our march. Towards night we went in on
      double quick, and though the luggage began to feel very heavy, everybody
      else was tired, too; and as for Jemmie, if I had not lent him an arm now
      and then he would have dropped by the way. I was all tired out when we
      came into camp, and then it was Jemmie's turn to be sentry. I would take
      his place; but I was too tired, father. I could not have kept awake if a
      gun had been pointed at my head; but I did not know it until&mdash;well,
      until it was too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God be thanked" interrupted Mr. Owen, reverently, "I knew Bennie was not
      the boy to sleep carelessly at his post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They tell me to-day that I have a short reprieve, 'time to write to you,'
      the good Colonel says. Forgive him, Father, he only does his duty; he
      would gladly save me if he could; and do not lay my death against Jemmie.
      The poor boy is heart-broken, and does nothing but beg and entreat them to
      let him die in my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't bear to think of mother and Blossom. Comfort them, Father! Tell
      them I die as a brave boy should, and that, when the war is over, they
      will not be ashamed of me, as they must be now. God help me! It is very
      hard to bear! Good-bye, father, God seems near and dear to me; not at all
      as if he wished me to perish forever, but as if he felt sorry for his poor
      sinful, broken-hearted child, and would take me to be with him and my
      Savior in a better life."
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep sigh burst from Mr. Owen's heart. "Amen," he said, solemnly,
      "amen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-night, in the early twilight, I shall see the cows all coming home
      from the pasture, and precious little Blossom standing on the back stoop,
      waiting for me! But I shall never, never come! God bless you all! Forgive
      your poor Bennie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night the door of the "back stoop" opened softly and a little
      figure glided out and down the footpath that led to the road by the mill.
      She seemed rather flying than walking, turning her head neither to the
      right nor left, looking only now and then to heaven, and folding her hands
      is if in prayer. Two hours later the same young girl stood at the mill
      depot, watching the coming of the night train; and the conductor, as he
      reached down to lift her into the car, wondered at the tear-stained face
      that was upturned toward the dim lantern he held in his hand. A few
      questions and ready answers told him all; and no father could have cared
      more tenderly for his only child than he for our little Blossom. She was
      on her way to Washington to ask President Lincoln for her brother's life.
      She had stolen away, leaving only a note to tell them where and why she
      had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought Bennie's letter with her; no good, kind heart like the
      President's could refuse to be melted by it. The next morning they reached
      New York, and the conductor hurried her on to Washington. Every minute,
      now, might be the means of saving her brother's life. And so, in an
      incredibly short time, Blossom reached the Capitol and hastened to the
      White House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president had just seated himself to his morning task of overlooking
      and signing important papers, when without one word of announcement the
      door softly opened, and Blossom, with down-cast eyes and folded hands,
      stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my child," he said in his pleasant, cheerful tones, "what do you
      want so bright and early this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bennie's life, sir," faltered Blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Bennie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My brother, sir. They are going to shoot him for sleeping at his post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes," and Mr. Lincoln ran his eye over the papers before him. "I
      remember. It was a fatal sleep. You see, my child, it was a time of
      special danger. Thousands of lives might have been lost by his culpable
      negligence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So my father said," replied Blossom, gravely. "But poor Bennie was so
      tired, sir, and Jemmie so weak. He did the work of two, sir, and it was
      Jemmie's night, not his; but Jemmie was too tired, and Bennie never
      thought about himself that he was tired too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this you say, child? Come here, I do not understand," and the
      kind man caught eagerly as ever at what seemed to be a justification of
      the offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom went to him; he put his hand tenderly on her shoulder and turned
      up the pale face toward his. How tall he seemed! And he was the President
      of the United States, too! A dim thought of this kind passed for a minute
      through Blossom's mind, but she told her simple, straightforward story and
      handed Mr. Lincoln Bennie's letter to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read it carefully; then taking up his pen, wrote a few hasty lines, and
      rang his bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blossom heard this order: "Send this dispatch at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The President then turned to the girl and said: "Go home, my child, and
      tell that father of yours, who could approve his country's sentence even
      when it took the life of a child like that, that Abraham Lincoln thinks
      the life far too precious to be lost. Go back, or&mdash;wait until
      tomorrow. Bennie will need a change after he has so bravely faced death;
      he shall go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you, sir!" said Blossom; and who shall doubt that God heard and
      registered the request?
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after this interview, the young soldier came to the White House
      with his little sister. He was called into the President's private room
      and a strap fastened upon his shoulder. Mr. Lincoln then said: "The
      soldier that could carry a sick comrade's baggage and die for the act so
      uncomplainingly deserves well of his country." Then Bennie and Blossom
      took their way to their Green Mountain home. A crowd gathered at the mill
      depot to welcome them back; and as Farmer Owen's hand grasped that of the
      boy, tears flowed down his cheeks, and he was heard to say fervently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lord be praised!"

      LITTLE BROWN THRUSHES.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Little brown thrushes at sunrise in summer
      After the May-flowers have faded away,
  Warble to show unto every new-comer
      How to hush stars, yet to waken the Day:
  Singing first, lullabies, then, jubilates,
  Watching the blue sky where every bird's heart is;
  Then, as lamenting the day's fading light,
  Down through the twilight, when wearied with flight,
  Singing divinely, they breathe out, "good-night!"

 Little brown thrushes with birds yellow-breasted
      Bright as the sunshine that June roses bring,
  Climb up and carol o'er hills silver-crested
      Just as the bluebirds do in the spring,
  Seeing the bees and the butterflies ranging,
  Pointed-winged swallows their sharp shadows changing;
  But while some sunset is flooding the sky,
  Up through the glory the brown thrushes fly,
  Singing divinely, "good-night and good-by!"

    <h2>
      THE STORY OF THE EMPTY SLEEVE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Here, sit ye down alongside of me; I'm getting old and gray;
  But something in the paper, boy, has riled my blood today.
  To steal a purse is mean enough, the most of men agree;
  But stealing reputation seems a meaner thing to me.

  A letter in the Herald says some generals allow
  That there wa'n't no fight where Lookout rears aloft its shaggy
  brow;
  But this coat sleeve swinging empty here beside me, boy, to-day,
  Tells a mighty different story in a mighty different way.

  When sunbeams flashed o'er Mission Ridge that bright November
  morn,
  The misty cap on Lookout's crest gave token of a storm;
  For grim King Death had draped the mount in grayish, smoky
  shrouds&mdash;
  Its craggy peaks were lost to sight above the fleecy clouds.

  Just at the mountain's rocky base we formed in serried lines,
  While lightning with its jagged edge played on us from the pines;
  The mission ours to storm the pits 'neath Lookout's crest that
  lay;
  We stormed the very "gates of hell" with "Fighting Joe" that day.

  The mountain seemed to vomit flames; the boom of heavy guns
  Played to Dixie's music, while a treble played the drums:
  The eagles waking from their sleep, looked down upon the stars
  Slow climbing up the mountain side, with morning's broken bars.

  We kept our eyes upon the flag that upward led the way
  Until we lost it in the smoke on Lookout side that day;
  And then like demons loosed from hell we clambered up the crag,
  "Excelsior," our motto, and our mission, "Save the flag."

  In answer to the rebel yell we gave a ringing cheer;
  We left the rifle-pits behind, the crest loomed upward near;
  A light wind playing 'long the peaks just lifted death's gray
  shroud;
  We caught the gleam of silver stars just breaking through the
  cloud.

  A shattered arm hung at my side that day on Lookout's crag,
  And yet I'd give the other now to save the dear old flag.
  The regimental roll when called on Lookout's crest that night
  Was more than doubled by the roll Death called in realms of
  light.

  Just as the sun sank slowly down behind the mountain's crest,
  When mountain peaks gave back the fire that flamed along the
  west,
  Swift riding down along the ridge upon a charger white,
  Came "Fighting Joe," the hero now of Lookout's famous fight.
  He swung his cap as tears of joy slow trickled down his cheek,
  And as our cheering died away, the general tried to speak.

  He said, "Boys, I'll court-martial you, yes, every man that's
  here;
  I said to take the rifle pits," we stopped him with a cheer,
  "I said to take the rifle pits upon the mountain's edge,
  And I'll court-martial you because&mdash;because you took the ridge"

  Then such a laugh as swept the ridge where late King Death had
  strode!
  And such a cheer as rent the skies, as down our lines he rode!
  I'm getting old and feeble, I've not long to live, I know,
  But there WAS A FIGHT AT LOOKOUT.  I was there with "Fighting
  Joe."

  So these generals in the Herald, they may reckon and allow
  That there warn't no fight at Lookout on the mountain's shaggy
  brow,
  But this empty coat-sleeve swinging here beside me, boy, to-day
  Tells a mighty different tale in a mighty different way.

    <h2>
      FACING THE WORLD.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Glad I am, mother, the holidays are over. It's quite different going back
      to school again when one goes to be captain&mdash;as I'm sure to be. Isn't
      it jolly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boyd's face as she smiled back at Donald was not exactly "jolly."
      Still, she did smile; and then there came out the strong likeness often
      seen between mother and son, even when, as in this case, the features were
      very dissimilar. Mrs. Boyd was a pretty, delicate little English woman:
      and Donald took after his father, a big, brawny Scotsman, certainly not
      pretty, and not always sweet. Poor man! he had of late years had only too
      much to make him sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she tried to smile and succeeded, the tears were in Mrs. Boyd's
      eyes, and her mouth was quivering. But she set it tightly together, and
      then she looked more than ever like her son, or rather, her son looked
      like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too eager in his delight to notice her much. "It is jolly, isn't
      it, mother? I never thought I'd get to the top of the school at all, for
      I'm not near so clever as some of the fellows. But now I've got my place;
      and I like it, and I mean to keep it; you'll be pleased at that, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have been if&mdash;if&mdash;" Mrs. Boyd tried to get the words
      out and failed, closed her eyes as tight as her mouth for a minute, then
      opened them and looked her boy in the face gravely and sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It goes to my heart to tell you&mdash;I have been waiting to say it all
      morning, but, Donald, my dear, you will never go back to school at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not go back; when I'm captain! why, you and father both said that if I
      got to be that, I should not stop till I was seventeen&mdash;and now I'm
      only fifteen and a half. O, mother, you don't mean it! Father couldn't
      break his word! I may go back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boyd shook her head sadly, and then explained as briefly and calmly
      as she could the heavy blow which had fallen upon the father, and, indeed,
      upon the whole family. Mr. Boyd had long been troubled with his eyes,
      about as serious a trouble as could have befallen a man in his profession&mdash;an
      accountant&mdash;as they call it in Scotland. Lately he had made some
      serious blunders in his arithmetic, and his eyesight was so weak that his
      wife persuaded him to consult a first-rate Edinburgh oculist, whose
      opinion, given only yesterday, after many days of anxious suspense, was
      that in a few months he would become incurably blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blind, poor father blind!" Donald put his hand before his own eyes. He
      was too big a boy to cry, or at any rate, to be seen crying, but it was
      with a choking voice that he spoke next: "I'll be his eyes; I'm old
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; in many ways you are, my son," said Mrs. Boyd, who had had a day and
      a night to face her sorrow, and knew she must do so calmly. "But you are
      not old enough to manage the business; your father will require to take a
      partner immediately, which will reduce our income one-half. Therefore we
      cannot possibly afford to send you to school again. The little ones must
      go, they are not nearly educated yet, but you are. You will have to face
      the world and earn your own living, as soon as ever you can. My poor boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call me poor, mother. I've got you and father and the rest. And, as
      you say, I've had a good education so far. And I'm fifteen and a half, no,
      fifteen and three-quarters&mdash;almost a man. I'm not afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," said his mother, who had waited a full minute before Donald could
      find voice to say all this, and it was at last stammered out awkwardly and
      at random. "No; I am not afraid because my boy has to earn his bread; I
      had earned mine for years as a governess when father married me. I began
      work before I was sixteen. My son will have to do the same, that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      That day the mother and son spoke no more together. It was as much as they
      could do to bear their trouble, without talking about it, and besides,
      Donald was not a boy to "make a fuss" over things. He could meet sorrow
      when it came, that is, the little of it he had ever known, but he disliked
      speaking of it, and perhaps he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he just "made himself scarce" till bedtime, and never said a word to
      anybody until his mother came into the boys' room to bid them good-night.
      There were three of them, but all were asleep except Donald. As his mother
      bent down to kiss him, he put both arms round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother, I'm going to begin to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begin what, my son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Facing the world, as you said I must. I can't go to school again, so I
      mean to try and earn my own living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite know, but I'll try. There are several things I could be, a
      clerk&mdash;or even a message-boy. I shouldn't like it, but I'd do
      anything rather than do nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boyd sat down on the side of the bed. If she felt inclined to cry she
      had too much sense to show it. She only took firm hold of her boy's hand,
      and waited for him to speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been thinking, mother, I was to have a new suit at Christmas; will
      you give it now? And let it be a coat, not a jacket. I'm tall enough&mdash;five
      feet seven last month, and growing still; I should look almost a man. Then
      I would go round to every office in Edinburgh and ask if they wanted a
      clerk. I wouldn't mind taking anything to begin with. And I can write a
      decent hand, and I'm not bad at figures; as for my Latin and Greek&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Donald gulped down a sigh, for he was a capital classic, and it had
      been suggested that he should go to Glasgow University and try for "the
      Snell" which has sent so many clever young Scotsmen to Balliol College,
      Oxford, and thence on to fame and prosperity. But alas! no college career
      was now possible to Donald Boyd. The best he could hope for was to earn a
      few shillings a week as a common clerk. He knew this, and so did his
      mother. But they never complained. It was no fault of theirs, nor of
      anybody's. It was just as they devoutly called it, "The will of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Latin and Greek may come in some day, my boy," said Mrs. Boyd
      cheerfully. "Good work is never lost. In the meantime, your plan is a good
      one, and you shall have your new clothes at once. Then, do as you think
      best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; good-night, mother," said Donald, and in five minutes more was
      fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, though he was much given to sleeping of nights&mdash;indeed, he never
      remembered lying awake for a single hour in his life&mdash;during daytime
      there never was a more "wide awake" boy than Donald Boyd. He kept his eyes
      open to everything, and never let the "golden minute" slip by him. He
      never idled about&mdash;play he didn't consider idling (nor do I). And I
      am bound to confess that every day until the new clothes came home was
      scrupulously spent in cricket, football, and all the other amusements
      which he was as good at as he was at his lessons. He wanted "to make the
      best of his holidays," he said, knowing well that for him holiday time as
      well as school time was now done, and the work of the world had begun in
      earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clothes came home on Saturday night, and he went to church in them on
      Sunday, to his little sister's great admiration. Still greater was their
      wonder when, on Monday morning, he appeared in the same suit, looking
      quite a man, as they unanimously agreed, and almost before breakfast was
      done, started off, not saying a word of where he was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not come back till the younger ones were all away to bed, so there
      was no one to question him, which was fortunate, for they might not have
      got very smooth answers. His mother saw this, and she also forbore. She
      was not surprised that the bright, brave face of the morning looked dull
      and tired, and that evidently Donald had no good news of the day to tell
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll go to bed," was all he said. "Mother, will you give me a
      'piece' in my pocket to-morrow? One can walk better when one isn't so
      desperately hungry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my boy." She kissed him, saw that he was warmed and fed&mdash;he had
      evidently been on his legs the whole day&mdash;then sent him off to his
      bed, where she soon heard him delightfully snoring, oblivious of all his
      cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thing went on day after day, for seven days. Sometimes he told
      his mother what had happened to him and where he had been, sometimes not;
      what was the good of telling? It was always the same story. Nobody wanted
      a boy or a man, for Donald, trusting to his inches and his coat, had
      applied for man's work also, but in vain. Mrs. Boyd was not astonished.
      She knew how hard it is to get one's foot into ever so small a corner in
      this busy world, where ten are always struggling for the place of one.
      Still, she also knew that it never does to give in; that one must leave no
      stone unturned if one wishes to get work at all. Also she believed firmly
      in an axiom of her youth&mdash;"Nothing is denied to well-directed labor."
      But it must be real hard "labor," and it must also be "well directed." So,
      though her heart ached sorely, as only a mother's can, she never betrayed
      it, but each morning sent her boy away with a cheerful face, and each
      evening received him with one, which, if less cheerful, was not less
      sympathetic, but she never said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the week's end, in fact, on Sunday morning, as they were walking to
      church, Donald said to her: "Mother, my new clothes haven't been of the
      slightest good. I've been all over Edinburgh, to every place I could think
      of&mdash;writers' offices, merchants' offices, wharves, railway-stations&mdash;but
      it's no use. Everybody wants to know where I've been before, and I've been
      nowhere except to school. I said I was willing to learn, but nobody will
      teach me; they say they can't afford it. It is like keeping a dog, and
      barking yourself. Which is only too true," added Donald, with a heavy
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May be," said Mrs. Boyd. Yet as she looked up at her son&mdash;she really
      did look up at him, he was so tall&mdash;she felt that if his honest,
      intelligent face and manly bearing did not win something at last, what was
      the world coming to? "My boy," she said, "things are very hard for you,
      but not harder than for others. I remember once, when I was only a few
      years older than you, finding myself with only half a crown in my pocket.
      To be sure it was a whole half-crown, for I had paid every half-penny I
      owed that morning, but I had no idea where the next half-crown would come
      from. However, it did come. I earned two pounds ten, the very day after
      that day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you really, mother?" said Donald, his eyes brightening. "Then I'll go
      on. I'll not 'gang awa back to my mither,' as that old gentleman advised
      me, who objected to bark himself; a queer, crabbed old fellow he was too,
      but he was the only one who asked my name and address. The rest of them&mdash;well,
      mother, I've stood a good deal these seven days," Donald added, gulping
      down something between a "fuff" of wrath and a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you have, my boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'll hold on; only you'll have to get my boots mended, and meantime,
      I should like to try a new dodge. My bicycle, it lies in the
      washing-house; you remember I broke it and you didn't wish it mended, lest
      I should break something worse than a wheel, perhaps. It wasn't worth
      while risking my life for mere pleasure, but I want my bicycle now for
      use. If you let me have it mended, I can go up and down the country for
      fifty miles in search of work&mdash;to Falkirk, Linlithgow, or even
      Glasgow, and I'll cost you nothing for traveling expenses. Isn't that a
      bright idea, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not the heart to say no, or to suggest that a boy on a bicycle
      applying for work was a thing too novel to be eminently successful. But to
      get work was at once so essential and so hopeless, that she would not
      throw any cold water on Donald's eagerness and pluck. She hoped too, that,
      spite of the eccentricity of the notion, some shrewd, kind-hearted
      gentleman might have sense enough to see the honest purpose of the poor
      lad who had only himself to depend upon. For his father had now fallen
      into a state of depression which made all application to him for either
      advice or help worse than useless. And as both he and Mrs. Boyd had been
      solitary orphans when they were married, there were no near relatives of
      any kind to come to the rescue. Donald knew, and his mother knew too, that
      he must shift for himself, to sink or swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, after two days' rest, which he much needed, the boy went off again "on
      his own hook," and his bicycle, which was a degree better than his legs,
      he said, as it saves shoe-leather. Also, he was able to come home pretty
      regularly at the same hour, which was a great relief to his mother. But he
      came home nearly as tired as ever, and with a despondent look which
      deepened every day. Evidently it was just the same story; no work to be
      had; or if there was work, it was struggled for by a score of fellows,
      with age, character, and experience to back them, and Donald had none of
      the three. But he had one quality, the root of all success in the end,
      dogged perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a saying, that we British gain our victories, not because we are
      never beaten, but because we never will see that we are beaten, and so go
      on fighting till we win. "Never say die," was Donald's word to his mother
      night after night. But she knew that those who never SAY die, sometimes DO
      die, quite quietly, and she watched with a sore heart her boy growing
      thinner and more worn, even though brown as a berry with constant exposure
      all day long to wind and weather, for it was now less autumn than winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a fortnight, Mrs. Boyd made up her mind that this could not go on
      any longer, and said so. "Very well," Donald answered, accepting her
      decision as he had been in the habit of doing all his life.&mdash;Mrs.
      Boyd's children knew very well that whatever her will was, it was sure to
      be a just and wise will, herself being the last person she ever thought
      of.&mdash;"Yes, I'll give in, if you think I ought, for it's only wearing
      out myself and my clothes to no good. Only let me have one day more and
      I'll go as far as ever I can, perhaps to Dunfermline, or even Glasgow."
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not forbid, and once more she started him off with a cheerful
      face in the twilight of the wet October morning, and sat all day long in
      the empty house&mdash;for the younger ones were now all going to school
      again&mdash;thinking sorrowfully of her eldest, whose merry school days
      were done forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk of the afternoon a card was brought up to her, with the
      message that an old gentleman was waiting below, wishing to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shudder ran through the poor mother, who, like many another mother,
      hated bicycles, and never had an easy mind when Donald was away on his.
      The stranger's first word was anything but reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon ma'am, but is your name Boyd, and have you a son called
      Donald, who went out on a bicycle this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes! Has anything happened? Tell me quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not aware, ma'am, that anything has happened," said the old
      gentleman. "I saw the lad at light this morning. He seemed to be managing
      his machine uncommonly well. I met him at the foot of a hill near
      Edinburgh Castle. He had got off and was walking; so he saw me, and took
      off his cap. I like respect, especially in a young fellow towards an old
      one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he know you, for I have not that pleasure?" said Mrs. Boyd, polite,
      though puzzled. For the old man did not look quite like a gentleman, and
      spoke with the strong accent of an uneducated person, yet he had a kindly
      expression, and seemed honest and well-meaning, though decidedly "canny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say he knew me, but he remembered me, which was civil of him.
      And then I minded the lad as the one that had come to me for work a week
      or two ago, and I took his name and address. That's your son's writing?"
      he jumbled out and showed a scrap of paper. "It's bona fide, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he really is in search of work? He hasn't run away from home, or been
      turned out by his father for misconduct, or anything of that sort? He
      isn't a scamp, or a ne'er-do-weel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope he doesn't look like it," said Mrs. Boyd, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, ma'am; you're right, he doesn't. He carries his character in his face
      which, maybe, is better than in his pocket. It was that which made me ask
      his name and address, though I could do nothing for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you were the gentleman who told him you couldn't keep a dog and bark
      yourself?" said Mrs. Boyd, amused, and just a shade hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely. Nor can I. It would have been cool impudence in a lad to come
      and ask to be taught his work first and then paid for it, if he hadn't
      been so very much in earnest that I was rather sorry for him. I'm inclined
      to believe, from the talk I had with him at the foot of the brae to-day,
      that he is a young dog that would bark with uncommon little teaching.
      Material, ma'am, is what we want. I don't care for its being raw material,
      if it's only of the right sort. I've made up my mind to try your boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, ma'am? But&mdash;I beg your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      For he saw that Mrs. Boyd had quite broken down. In truth, the strain had
      been so long and so great that this sudden relief was quite too much for
      her. She sobbed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to beg your pardon," she said at last, "for being so foolish, but
      we have had hard times of late."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in a few simple words, she told Donald's whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man listened to it in silence. Sometimes he nodded his head, or
      beat his chin on his stout stick as he sat; but he made no comment
      whatever, except a brief "Thank you, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now to business," continued he, taking out his watch; "for I'm due at
      dinner: and I always keep my appointments, even with myself. I hope your
      Donald is a punctual lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He promised to be back by dark, and I am sure he will be. Could you
      not wait?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I never wait for anybody; but keep nobody waiting for me. I'm Bethune
      &amp; Co., Leith Merchants&mdash;practically, old John Bethune, who began
      life as a message-boy, and has done pretty well, considering."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, as Mrs. Boyd was well aware. Bethune &amp; Co. was a name so well
      known that she could hardly believe in her boy's good luck in getting into
      that house in any capacity whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So all is settled," said Mr. Bethune, rising. "Let him come to me on
      Monday morning, and I'll see what he is fit for. He'll have to start at
      the very bottom&mdash;sweep the office, perhaps&mdash;I did it myself once&mdash;and
      I'll give him&mdash;let me see&mdash;ten shillings a week to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To begin with,'" repeated Mrs. Boyd, gently but firmly; "but he will
      soon be worth more. I am sure of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. When I see what stuff he is made of, he shall have a rise. But
      I never do things at haphazard; and it's easier going up than coming down.
      I'm not a benevolent man, Mrs. Boyd, and you need not think it. But I've
      fought the world pretty hard myself, and I like to help those that are
      fighting it. Good evening. Isn't that your son coming round the corner?
      Well, he's back exact to his time, at any rate. Tell him I hope he will be
      as punctual on Monday morning. Good evening, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if this were an imaginary story, I might wind it up by a delightful
      denoument of Mr. Bethune's turning out an old friend of the family, or
      developing into a new one, and taking such a fancy to Donald that he
      immediately gave him a clerkship with a large salary, and the promise of a
      partnership on coming of age, or this worthy gentleman should be an
      eccentric old bachelor who immediately adopted that wonderful boy and
      befriended the whole Boyd family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither of these things, nor anything else remarkable, happened in the
      real story, which, as it is literally true, though told with certain
      necessary disguises, I prefer to keep to as closely as I can. Such
      astonishing bits of "luck" do not happen in real life, or happen so rarely
      that one inclines, at least, to believe very little in either good or ill
      fortune, as a matter of chance. There is always something at the back of
      it which furnishes a key to the whole. Practically, a man's lot is of his
      own making. He may fail, for a while undeservedly, or he may succeed
      undeservedly, but, in the long run, time brings its revenges and its
      rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it did to Donald Boyd. He has not been taken into the house of Bethune
      &amp; Co., as a partner; and it was long before he became even a clerk&mdash;at
      least with anything like a high salary. For Mr. Bethune, so far from being
      an old bachelor, had a large family to provide for, and was bringing up
      several of his sons to his own business, so there was little room for a
      stranger. But a young man who deserves to find room generally does find
      it, or make it. And though Donald started at the lowest rung of the
      ladder, he may climb to the top yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had "a fair field, and no favor." Indeed, he neither wished nor asked
      favor. He determined to stand on his own feet from the first. He had hard
      work and few holidays, made mistakes, found them out and corrected them,
      got sharp words and bore them, learnt his own weak points and&mdash;not so
      easily&mdash;his strong ones. Still he did learn them; for, unless you can
      trust yourself, be sure nobody else will trust you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Donald's great point. HE WAS TRUSTED. People soon found out that
      they might trust him; that he always told the truth, and never pretended
      to do more than he could do; but that which he could do, they might depend
      upon his doing, punctually, accurately, carefully, and never leaving off
      till it was done. Therefore, though others might be quicker, sharper, more
      "up to things" than he, there was no one so reliable, and it soon got to
      be a proverb in the office of Bethune &amp; Co.&mdash;and other offices,
      too&mdash;"If you wish a thing done, go to Boyd."
    </p>
    <p>
      I am bound to say this, for I am painting no imaginary portrait, but
      describing an individual who really exists, and who may be met any day
      walking about Edinburgh, though his name is not Donald Boyd, and there is
      no such firm as Bethune &amp; Co. But the house he does belong to values
      the young fellow so highly that there is little doubt he will rise in it,
      and rise in every way, probably to the very top of the tree, and tell his
      children and grandchildren the story which, in its main features, I have
      recorded here, of how he first began facing the world.

    <h2>
      ROBERT OF LINCOLN.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Merrily swinging on briar and weed,
      Near to the nest of his little dame,
  Over the mountain-side or mead,
      Robert of Lincoln is telling his name;
           Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  Snug and safe in that nest of ours,
  Hidden among the summer flowers.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Robert of Lincoln is gayly dressed.
      Wearing a bright black wedding-coat;
  White are his shoulders and white his crest,
      Hear him calling his merry note:
           Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  Look, what a nice new coat is mine,
  Sure there was never a bird so fine.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,
      Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,
  Passing at home a quiet life,
      Broods in the grass while her husband sings:
           Bob-o'-l ink, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  Brood, kind creatures; you need not fear
  Thieves and robbers while I am here.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Modest and shy as a nun is she,
      One weak chirp is her only note,
  Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,
      Pouring boasts from his little throat:
           Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  Never was I afraid of man;
  Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Six white eggs on a bed of hay,
      Flecked with purple, a pretty sight!
  There as the mother sits all day,
      Robert is singing with all his might:
           Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  Nice good wife, that never goes out,
  Keeping house while I frolic about.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Soon as the-little ones chip the shell
      Six wide mouths are open for food;
  Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well,
      Gathering seed for the hungry brood.
           Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  This new life is likely to be
  Hard for a gay young fellow like me.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Robert of Lincoln at length is made
      Sober with work, and silent with care;
  Off is his holiday garment laid,
      Half forgotten that merry air,

          Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  Nobody knows but my mate and I
  Where our nest and our nestlings lie.
                Chee, chee, chee.

 Summer wanes; the children are grown;
      Fun and frolic no more he knows;
  Robert of Lincoln's a humdrum crone;
      Off he flies, and we sing as he goes:
           Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
           Spink, spank, spink;
  When you can pipe that merry old strain,
  Robert of Lincoln, come back again.
               Chee, chee, chee.

 My papa's all dressed up to-day;
      He never looked so fine;
  I thought when I first looked at him
     My papa wasn't mine.

 He's got a beautiful new suit
      The old one was so old&mdash;
It's blue, with buttons, oh, so bright,      I guess they must be gold.

 And papa's sort o' glad and sort
      O' sad&mdash;I wonder why;
  And ev'ry time she looks at him
     It makes my mamma cry.

 Who's Uncle Sam?  My papa says

    <h2>
      "DIXIE" AND "YANKEE DOODLE."
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 I was born 'way down in "Dixie,"
      Reared beneath the Southern skies,
  And they didn't have to teach me
      Every "Yankee" to despise.

 I was but a country youngster
      When I donned a suit of gray,
  When I shouldered my old musket,
      And marched forth the "Yanks" to slay.

 Four long years I fought and suffered,
      "Dixie" was my battle cry;
  "Dixie" always and forever,
      Down in "Dixie" let me die.

 And to-night I'm down in "Dixie,"
      "Dixie" still so grand and true;
  But to-night I am appareled
      In a uniform of blue.

 And to-night the band is playing;
      'Tis not "Dixie's" strains I hear,
  But the strains of "Yankee Doodle"
      Ring out strong and clear.

 Long I listen to the music;
      By my side a comrade stands;
  He's a "Yank" and I'm a "Rebel,"
      But we grasp each other's hands.

 Here together we united
      'Way down South in "Dixie" stand,
  And my comrade whispers softly,
      "There's no land like 'Dixie's land.'"

 But my eyes are filled with teardrops,
      Tears that make my heart feel glad;
  And I whisper to my comrade:
      "'Yankee Doodle' ain't so bad."

 A game of marbles
  We were having one day,
  When Baby chanced
      to come along that way.
  Too little he was
      to join our game,
  But he pocketed our marbles

    <h2>
      THE BAREFOOT BOY.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Blessings on thee, little man,
  Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan;
  With thy turned-up pantaloons,
  And thy merry whistled tunes;
  With thy red lip, redder still
  Kissed by strawberries on the hill;
  With the sunshine on thy face,
  Through thy torn brim's jaunty grace!
  From my heart I give thee joy;
  I was once a barefoot boy.

 Prince thou art&mdash;the grown-up man
  Only is republican.
  Let the million-dollared ride!
  Barefoot, trudging at his side,
  Thou hast more than he can buy,
  In the reach of ear and eye:
  Outward sunshine, inward joy.
  Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!

 O!  for boyhood's painless play,
  Sleep that wakes in laughing day,
  Health that mocks the doctor's rules,
  Knowledge never learned of schools:
  Of the wild bee's morning chase,
  Of the wild flower's time and place,
  Flight of fowl, and habitude
  Of the tenants of the wood;
  How the tortoise bears his shell,

 How the woodchuck digs his cell,
  And the ground-mole sinks his well;
  How the robin feeds her young,
  How the oriole's nest is hung;
  Where the whitest lilies blow,
  Where the freshest berries grow,
  Where the ground-nut trails its vine,
  Where the wood grape's clusters shine;
  Of the black wasp's cunning way,
  Mason of his walls of clay,
  And the architectural plans
  Of gray hornet artisans!
  For, eschewing books and tasks,
  Nature answers all he asks;
  Hand in hand with her he walks,
  Face to face with her he talks
  Part and parcel of her joy.
  Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!

 O for boyhood's time of June,
  Crowding years in one brief moon,
  When all things I heard or saw,
  Me, their master, waited for!
  I was rich in flowers and trees,
  Humming-birds and honey-bees;
  For my sport the squirrel played,
  Plied the snouted mole his spade;
  For my taste the blackberry cone
  Purpled over hedge and stone;
  Laughed the brook for my delight,
  Through the day and through the night;
  Whispering at the garden wall,
  Talked with me from fall to fall;

 Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,
  Mine the walnut slopes beyond,
  Mine, on bending orchard trees,
  Apples of Hesperides!
  Still, as my horizon grew,
  Larger grew my riches too,
  All the world I saw or knew
  Seemed a complex Chinese toy,
  Fashioned for a barefoot boy!

 O!  for festal dainties spread,
  Like my bowl of milk and bread,
  Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,
  On the door-stone, gray and rude!
  O'er me, like a regal tent,
  Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent:
  Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,
  Looped in many a wind-swung fold;
  While, for music, came the play
  Of the pied frogs' orchestra;
  And, to light the noisy choir,
  Lit the fly his lamp of fire.
  I was monarch; pomp and joy
  Waited on the barefoot boy.

 Cheerily then, my little man!
  Live and laugh as boyhood can;
  Though the flinty slopes be hard,
  Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,
  Every morn shall lead thee through
  Fresh baptisms of the dew;
  Every evening from thy feet
  Shall the cool wind kiss the heat;

 All too soon those feet must hide
  In the prison-cells of pride,
  Lose the freedom of the sod,
  Like a colt's for work be shod,
  Made to tread the mills of toil,
  Up and down in ceaseless moil:
  Happy if their track be found
  Never on forbidden ground;
  Happy if they sink not in
  Quick and treacherous sands of sin.
  Ah!  that thou couldst know thy joy,
  Ere it passes, barefoot boy!
               JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.

    <h2>
      BABOUSCKA.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you were a Russian child you would not watch to see Santa Klaus come
      down the chimney; but you would stand by the windows to catch a peep at
      poor Babouscka as she hurries by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who is Babouscka? Is she Santa Klaus' wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, indeed. She is only a poor little crooked wrinkled old woman, who
      comes at Christmas time into everybody's house, who peeps into every
      cradle, turns back every coverlid, drops a tear on the baby's white
      pillow, and goes away very, very sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not only at Christmas time, but through all the cold winter, and
      especially in March, when the wind blows loud, and whistles and howls and
      dies away like a sigh, the Russian children hear the rustling step of the
      Babouscka. She is always in a hurry. One hears her running fast along the
      crowded streets and over the quiet country fields. She seems to be out of
      breath and tired, yet she hurries on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom is she trying to overtake?
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely looks at the little children as they press their rosy faces
      against the window pane and whisper to each other, "Is the Babouscka
      looking for us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she will not stop; only on Christmas eve will she come up-stairs into
      the nursery and give each little one a present. You must not think she
      leaves handsome gifts such as Santa Klaus brings for you. She does not
      bring bicycles to the boys or French dolls to the girls. She does not come
      in a gay little sleigh drawn by reindeer, but hobbling along on foot, and
      she leans on a crutch. She has her old apron filled with candy and cheap
      toys, and the children all love her dearly. They watch to see her come,
      and when one hears a rustling, he cries, "Lo! the Babouscka!" then all
      others look, but one must turn one's head very quickly or she vanishes. I
      never saw her myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best of all, she loves little babies, and often, when the tired mothers
      sleep, she bends over their cradles, puts her brown, wrinkled face close
      down to the pillow and looks very sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is she looking for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, that you can't guess unless you know her sad story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long, long ago, a great many yesterdays ago, the Babouscka, who was even
      then an old woman, was busy sweeping her little hut. She lived in the
      coldest corner of cold Russia, and she lived alone in a lonely place where
      four wide roads met. These roads were at this time white with snow, for it
      was winter time. In the summer, when the fields were full of flowers and
      the air full of sunshine and singing birds, Babouscka's home did not seem
      so very quiet; but in the winter, with only the snowflakes and the shy
      snow-birds and the loud wind for company, the little old woman felt very
      cheerless. But she was a busy old woman, and as it was already twilight,
      and her home but half swept, she felt in a great hurry to finish her work
      before bedtime. You must know the Babouscka was poor and could not afford
      to do her work by candle-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, down the widest and the lonesomest of the white roads, there
      appeared a long train of people coming. They were walking slowly, and
      seemed to be asking each other questions as to which way they should take.
      As the procession came nearer, and finally stopped outside the little hut,
      Babouscka was frightened at the splendor. There were Three Kings, with
      crowns on their heads, and the jewels on the Kings' breastplates sparkled
      like sunlight. Their heavy fur cloaks were white with the falling
      snow-flakes, and the queer humpy camels on which they rode looked white as
      milk in the snow-storm. The harness on the camels was decorated with gold,
      and plates of silver adorned the saddles. The saddle-cloths were of the
      richest Eastern stuffs, and all the servants had the dark eyes and hair of
      an Eastern people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaves carried heavy loads on their backs, and each of the Three Kings
      carried a present. One carried a beautiful transparent jar, and in the
      fading light Babouscka could see in it a golden liquid which she knew from
      its color must be myrrh. Another had in his hand a richly woven bag, and
      it seemed to be heavy, as indeed it was, for it was full of gold. The
      third had a stone vase in his hand, and from the rich perfume which filled
      the snowy air, one could guess the vase to have been filled with incense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Babouscka was terribly frightened, so she hid herself in her hut, and let
      the servants knock a long time at her door before she dared open it and
      answer their questions as to the road they should take to a far-away town.
      You know she had never studied a geography lesson in her life, was old and
      stupid and scared. She knew the way across the fields to the nearest
      village, but she know nothing else of all the wide world full of cities.
      The servants scolded, but the Three Kings spoke kindly to her, and asked
      her to accompany them on their journey that she might show them the way as
      far as she knew it. They told her, in words so simple that she could not
      fail to understand, that they had seen a Star in the sky and were
      following it to a little town where a young Child lay. The snow was in the
      sky now, and the Star was lost out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the Child?" asked the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a King, and we go to worship him," they answered. "These presents
      of gold, frankincense and myrrh are for Him. When we find Him we will take
      the crowns off our heads and lay them at His feet. Come with us,
      Babouscka!"
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you suppose? Shouldn't you have thought the poor little woman
      would have been glad to leave her desolate home on the plains to accompany
      these Kings on their journey?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the foolish woman shook her head. No, the night was dark and
      cheerless, and her little home was warm and cosy. She looked up into the
      sky, and the Star was nowhere to be seen. Besides, she wanted to put her
      hut in order&mdash;perhaps she would be ready to go to-morrow. But the
      Three Kings could not wait; so when to-morrow's sun rose they were far
      ahead on their journey. It seemed like a dream to poor Babouscka, for even
      the tracks of the camels' feet were covered by the deep white snow.
      Everything was the same as usual; and to make sure that the night's
      visitors had not been a fancy, she found her old broom hanging on a peg
      behind the door, where she had put it when the servants knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the sun was shining, and she remembered the glitter of the gold
      and the smell of the sweet gums and myrrh, she wished she had gone with
      the travelers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she thought a great deal about the dear Baby the Three Kings had gone
      to worship. She had no children of her own&mdash;nobody loved her&mdash;ah,
      if she had only gone! The more she brooded on the thought, the more
      miserable she grew, till the very sight of her home became hateful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a dreadful feeling to realize that one has lost a chance of
      happiness. There is a feeling called remorse that can gnaw like a sharp
      little tooth. Babouscka felt this little tooth cut into her heart every
      time she remembered the visit of the Three Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while the thought of the Little Child became her first thought at
      waking and her last at night. One day she shut the door of her house
      forever, and set out on a long journey. She had no hope of overtaking the
      Three Kings, but she longed to find the Child, that she too might love and
      worship Him. She asked every one she met, and some people thought her
      crazy, but others gave her kind answers. Have you perhaps guessed that the
      young Child whom the Three Kings sought was our Lord himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      People told Babouscka how He was born in a manger, and many other things
      which you children have learned long ago. These answers puzzled the old
      dame mightily. She had but one idea in her ignorant head. The Three Kings
      had gone to seek a Baby. She would, if not too late, seek Him too.
    </p>
    <p>
      She forgot, I am sure, how many long years had gone by. She looked in vain
      for the Christ-child in His manger-cradle. She spent all her little
      savings in toys and candy so as to make friends with little children, that
      they might not run away when she came hobbling into their nurseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you know for whom she is sadly seeking when she pushes back the
      bed-curtains and bends down over each baby's pillow. Sometimes, when the
      old grandmother sits nodding by the fire, and the bigger children sleep in
      their beds, old Babouscka comes hobbling into the room, and whispers
      softly, "Is the young Child here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, no; she has come too late, too late. But the little children know her
      and love her. Two thousand years ago she lost the chance of finding Him.
      Crooked, wrinkled, old, sick and sorry, she yet lives on, looking into
      each baby's face&mdash;always disappointed, always seeking. Will she find
      Him at last?

      DAISIES.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Daisies!

   Low in the grass and high in the clover,
    Starring the green earth over and over,
    Now into white waves tossing and breaking,
    Like a foaming sea when the wind is waking,
    Now standing upright, tall and slender,
    Showing their deep hearts' golden splendor;
        Daintily bending,
        Airily lending

   Garlands of flowers for earth's adorning,
    Fresh with the dew of a summer morning;
    High on the slope, low in the hollow,
    Where eye can reach or foot can follow,
    Shining with innocent fearless faces
    Out of the depths of lonely places,
        Till the glad heart sings their praises
             &mdash;Here are the daisies!
             The daisies!

                 Daisies!
     See them ebbing and flowing,
    Like tides with the full moon going;
    Spreading their generous largess free
    For hand to touch and for eye to see;
        In dust of the wayside growing,
        On rock-ribbed upland blowing,
        By meadow brooklets glancing,
        On barren fields a-dancing,
    Till the world forgets to burrow and grope,
  And rises aloft on the wings of hope;
             &mdash;Oh!  of all posies,
  Lilies or roses,
             Sweetest or fairest,
  Richest or rarest,
    That earth in its joy to heaven upraises,
             Give me the daisies!

   Why?  For they glow with the spirit of youth,
    Their beautiful eyes have the glory of truth,
    Down before all their rich bounty they fling
    &mdash;Free to the beggar, and free to the king

   Loving they stoop to the lowliest ways,
    Joyous they brighten the dreariest days;
    Under the fringe of their raiment they hide
    Scars the gray winter hath opened so wide;
             Freely and brightly&mdash;
            Who can count lightly
    Gifts with such generous ardor proffered,
    Tokens of love from such full heart's offered,
    Or look without glances of joy and delight
    At pastures star-covered from morning till night,
             When the sunshiny field ablaze is
                  With daisies!

                      Daisies,
                  Your praise is,
    That you are like maidens, as maidens should be,
    Winsome with freshness, and wholesome to see,
    Gifted with beauty, and joy to the eye,
    Head lifted daintily&mdash;yet not too high&mdash;
    Sweet with humility, radiant with love,
    Generous too as the sunshine above,
    Swaying with sympathy, tenderly bent
    On hiding the scar and on healing the rent,
    Innocent-looking the world in the face,
    Yet fearless with nature's own innocent grace,
    Full of sweet goodness, yet simple in art,
    White in the soul, and pure gold in the heart
    &mdash;Ah, like unto you should all maidenhood be
    Gladsome to know, and most gracious to see;
             Like you, my daisies!

    <h2>
      DRIVING HOME THE COWS.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Out of the clover and blue-eyed grass,
         He turned them into the river lane;
     One after another he let them pass,
         Then fastened the meadow bars again.

    Along by the willows and over the hill
         He patiently followed their sober pace&mdash;
     The merry whistle for once was still
         And something shadowed the sunny face.

    Only a boy, and his father had said
         He never could let his youngest go,
     Two already were lying dead
         Under the feet of the trampling foe.

    But, after the evening work was done,
         And the frogs were loud in the meadow swamp,
     Over his shoulder he slung his gun
         And stealthily followed the footpath damp.

    Across the clover and through the wheat,
         With resolute heart and purpose grim,
     Though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet,
         And the blind bat's flitting startled him.

    Thrice since then have the lanes been white
         And the orchards sweet with apple bloom,
     And now when the cows came back at night
         The feeble father drove them home;

    For news had come to the lonely farm
         That three were lying where two had lain,
     And the old man's tremulous, palsied arm
         Could never lean on a son's again.

    The summer day grew cool and late,
         He went for the cows when his work was done,
     But down the lane, as he opened the gate,
         He saw them coming, one by one.

    Brindle and Ebony, Speckle and Bess,
         Tossing their horns in the evening wind,
     Cropping the buttercups out of the grass,
         But who was it following close behind?

    Loosely swung in the idle air
         The empty sleeve of army blue,
     And worn and pale through its crisped hair
         Looked out a face that the father knew.

    For Southern prisons will sometimes yawn
         And yield their dead to life again,
    And the day that comes with a cloudy dawn
        In golden glory at last may wane.

    The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes,
         For the hearts must speak when the lips are dumb,
     And under the silent evening skies
         Together they followed the cattle home.

    <h2>
      THE BABY'S KISS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN INCIDENT OF THE CIVIL WAR.
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Rough and ready the troopers ride,
  Pistol in holster and sword by side;
  They have ridden long, they have ridden hard,
  They are travel-stained and battle-scarred;
  The hard ground shakes with their martial tramp,
  And coarse is the laugh of the men of the camp.

 They reach the spot where a mother stands
  With a baby shaking its little hands,
  Laughing aloud at the gallant sight
  Of the mounted soldiers, fresh from the fight.
  The captain laughs out, "I will give you this,
  A bright piece of gold, your baby to kiss."

 "My darling's kisses cannot be sold,
  But gladly he'll kiss a soldier bold."
  He lifts up the babe with a manly grace,
  And covers with kisses its smiling face.
  Its rosy cheeks and its dimpled charms,
  And it crows with delight in the soldier's arms.

 "Not all for the captain," the troopers call;
  "The baby, we know, has a kiss for all."
  To each soldier's breast the baby is pressed
  By the strong rough men, and kissed and caressed.
  And louder it laughs, and the lady's face
  Wears a mother's smile at the fond embrace.

 "Just such a kiss," cried one warrior grim,
  "When I left my boy I gave to him;"
  "And just such a kiss on the parting day,
  I gave to my girl as asleep she lay."
  Such were the words of these soldiers brave,
  And their eyes were moist when the kiss they gave.
                           ANON.

    <h2>
      THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The grand old kingdom of England, in the course of the mossy centuries you
      can count over its head, has had its times of gloom and depression at
      dangers that looked near, and its times of shouting and rejoicing over
      dangers its brave men have driven away quite out of sight again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the deepest seasons of gloom was when the French Emperor, Napoleon,
      had conquered one country after another, until there was scarcely anything
      but England left to attack; and one of the proudest times of rejoicing was
      when the "Iron Duke" Wellington, and the bluff old Prussian, Blucher, met
      him at Waterloo, defeated his armies and drove him from the field. There
      were bonfires, and bell-ringings then, and from that day onward England
      loved and cherished every man who had fought at Waterloo&mdash;from the
      "Duke" himself down to the plainest private, every one was a hero and a
      veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the humblest houses of a proud nobleman's estate, a low,
      whitewashed cottage, one of these veterans lived not so very many years
      ago. He had fought by his flag in one of the most gallant regiments until
      the last hour of the battle, and then had fallen disabled from active
      service for the rest of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That did not seem to be of so very great consequence though, just now; for
      peace reigned in the land, and with his wife and two beautiful daughters
      to love, his battles to think over, and his pension to provide the bread
      and coffee, the old soldier was as happy as the day was long. It made no
      difference that the bread and the coffee were both black, and the clothes
      of the veteran were coarse and seldom new.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, Peggy!" he used to say to his wife, "my cloak is as fine as the one
      the 'Iron Duke' wore when they carried me past him just as the French were
      breaking; and as for the bread, only a veteran knows how the recollection
      of victory makes everything taste sweet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seemed as if the old soldier's life was going to prove like his
      share in that great day at Waterloo&mdash;success and victory till the end
      had nearly come, and then one shot after another striking him with
      troubles, he could never get over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first came in the midst of the beautiful summer days, when the bees
      droned through the delicious air, the rose-bush was in full bloom, and the
      old soldier sat in the cottage door reveling in it all. A slow, merciless
      fever rose up through the soft air&mdash;it did not venture near the high
      ground where the castle stood, but it crept noiselessly into the
      whitewashed cottage, one night, and the soldier's two daughters were
      stricken down. This was the beginning of terrible trouble to the veteran
      of Waterloo. Not that he minded watching, for he was used to standing
      sentry all night, and as for nursing, he had seen plenty in the hospital;
      but to see his daughters suffering&mdash;that was what he could not bear!
    </p>
    <p>
      And worst of all, between medicines and necessaries for the sick, the
      three months' pension was quite used up, and when the old soldier's
      nursing had pulled through the fierceness of the fever, there was nothing
      but black bread left in the house&mdash;and black bread was almost the
      same as no bread at all to the dainty appetities the fever had left; and
      that was what he had to think of, and think of, as he sat in the cottage
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" said the old soldier, with something more like a groan than was
      ever heard from him while his wounds were being dressed, "I could face all
      the armies of Napoleon better than this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sat more and more in the cottage door, as if that could leave the
      trouble behind; but it stood staring before him, all the same, till it
      almost shut the rosebush and the bees out of sight. But one morning a
      tremendous surprise came to him like a flash out of the sky! He heard the
      sound of galloping troops, and he pricked up his ears, for that always
      made him think of a cavalry charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who goes there?" he cried; but without answering his challenge the sound
      came nearer and nearer, and a lackey in full livery dashed up to the door,
      and presented him with a note sealed with the blood-red seal of the castle
      arms. It was an invitation to dine at the castle with a company of
      noblemen and officers of the army. His lordship, who had also fought at
      Waterloo, had just learned that a comrade was living on his estate, and
      made haste to do him honor, and secure a famous guest for his dinner
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier rose up proudly, and gave the lackey a military salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell his lordship," he said, "that I shall report myself at headquarters,
      and present my thanks for the honor he has done me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lackey galloped off, and the veteran pushed his chair over with his
      wooden leg, and clattered across the cottage floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, Peggy!" he cried, "did I not say that luck comes and trouble flies if
      you only face the enemy long enough? This is the beginning of good things,
      I tell you! A hero of Waterloo, and fit to dine with lords and generals,
      will certainly have other good fortune coming to him, till he can keep his
      wife and daughters like princesses. Just wait a bit and you shall see!"
      and he turned hastily away, for his heart came up in his throat so that he
      could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of that day he sat in the door, brushing and darning and
      polishing his stained uniform. It had lain abandoned on the shelf for many
      a year, but before night every button was shining like gold, the scarlet
      cloth was almost fresh once more, and the old soldier, wrapped in his
      faithful cloak, was making his way joyfully across the heathery moors to
      the castle quite at the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he had fairly reached it, and the servant had shown him into the
      drawing-room, his heart almost failed him for a moment. Such splendor he
      had never seen before&mdash;a thousandth part would have bought health and
      happiness for the dear ones he had left with only his brave goodbye and a
      fresh rose-bud to comfort them!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, what with the beautiful ladies of the castle gathering round him
      to ask questions about the battle, and with a seat near his lordship's
      right hand at dinner, he soon plucked up again, and began to realize how
      delightful everything was. But that was the very thing that almost spoiled
      the whole again, for when he saw his plate covered with luxuries and
      delicacies more than he could possibly eat, the thought of the black bread
      he had left at the cottage brought the tears rushing to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, "Tut!" he said to himself in great dismay, "what an ungrateful
      poltroon his lordship will think he has brought here!" and he managed to
      brush them off while no one was looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was delicious, though, in spite of everything, and after a while the
      wine began to flow&mdash;that warmed his very heart&mdash;and then he
      heard his lordship calling to a servant to bring him something from his
      private desk, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, I am about to show you the proudest treasure I possess. This
      diamond snuff-box was presented to me by the stout old Blucher himself, in
      remembrance of service I was able to perform at Waterloo. Not that I was a
      whit worthier of it than the brave fellows under my command&mdash;understand
      that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      How the diamonds glistened and gleamed as the box was passed from hand to
      hand! As if the thickest cluster of stars you ever saw, could shine out in
      the midst of a yellow sunset sky, and the colors of the rainbow could
      twinkle through them at the same time! It was superb, but then that was
      nothing compared to the glory of receiving it from Blucher!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was more wine and story-telling, and at last some asked to look
      at the snuff-box again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has any one the snuff-box at present?" asked his lordship, rather
      anxiously, for as he turned to reach it no snuff-box was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one said "yes," for everyone was sure he had passed it to his neighbor,
      and they searched up and down the table with consternation in their faces,
      for the snuff-box could not have disappeared without hands, but to say so
      was to touch the honor of gentlemen and soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one of the most famous officers rose from his seat:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," he said, "a very unlucky accident must have occurred here. Some
      one of us must have slipped the box into his pocket unconsciously,
      mistaking it for his own. I will take the lead in searching mine, if the
      rest of the company will follow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed!" said the rest, and each guest in turn went to the bottom of one
      pocket after another, but still no snuff-box, and the distress of the
      company increased. The old soldier's turn came last, and with it came the
      surprise. With burning cheeks and arms folded closely across his breast he
      stood up and confronted the company like a stag at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" he exclaimed, "no one shall search my pockets! Would you doubt the
      honor of a soldier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we have all done so," said the rest, "and every one knows it is the
      merest accident at the most." But the old soldier only held his arms the
      tighter, while the color grew deeper in his face. In his perplexity his
      lordship thought of another expedient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will try another way, gentlemen," he said, "I will order a basket of
      bran to be brought, and propose that each one in turn shall thrust his
      hand into the bran. No one shall look on, and if we find the box at last,
      no one can guess whose hand placed it there."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quickly done, and hand after hand was thrust in, until at last came
      the old soldier's turn once more. But he was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at last the indignation of the company broke forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A soldier, and a hero of Waterloo, and willing to be a thief!" and with
      their distress about the affair, and his lordship's grief at his loss, the
      evening was entirely spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the old soldier, with his faithful cloak wrapped closely round
      him once more, was fighting his way through the sharp winds and over the
      moors again. But a battle against something a thousand times sharper and
      colder was going on in his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thief!" he was saying over and over to himself, "me, who fought close
      to the side of the 'Iron Duke'! And yet, can I look one of them in the
      face and tell him he lies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The walk that had been gone over so merrily was a terrible one to retrace,
      and when the cottage was reached, instead of the pride and good luck the
      poor invalids had been watching for, a gloom deadlier than the fever
      followed him in. He sat in the doorway as he used, but sometimes he hung
      his head on his breast, and sometimes started up and walked proudly about,
      crying&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peggy! I say no one shall call me a thief! I am a soldier of the Iron
      Duke!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But they did call him a thief, though, for a very strange thing, after his
      lordship had sorrowfully ordered the cottage and little garden spot to be
      searched no box was found, and the gloom and the mystery grew deeper
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good nursing could not balance against trouble like this; the beautiful
      daughters faded and died, the house was too gloomy to stay inside, and if
      he escaped to the door, he had to hear the passers say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There sits the soldier who stole the Blucher diamonds from his host!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And as if this was not enough, one day the sound of hoofs was heard again,
      and a rider in uniform clattered up to the door saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade, I am sent to tell you that your pension is stopped! His Majesty
      cannot count a thief any longer a soldier of his!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the old soldier hardly held up his head at all, and his hair,
      that had kept black as a coal all these years, turned white as the moors
      when the winter snows lay on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though that is all the same, Peggy," he used to say, "for it is winter
      all the year round with me! If I could only die as the old year does! That
      would be the thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But long and merciless as the winter is, spring does come at last, if we
      can but live and fight our way through the storms and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night a cry of fire roused all the country-side. All but the old
      soldier. He heard them say the castle was burning, but what was that to
      him? Nothing could burn away the remembrance that he had once been called
      a thief within its walls! But the next morning he heard a step&mdash;not a
      horse's hoof this time, but a strong man walking hastily towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the veteran of Waterloo?" asked his lordship's voice, and when
      the old soldier stepped forward, he threw his arms about his neck with
      tears and sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comrade," he said, "come up to the castle! The snuff-box is found, and I
      want you to stand in the very room where it was lost while I tell everyone
      what a great and sorrowful wrong a brave and honest soldier has suffered
      at my hands!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not take many words to explain. In the first alarm of fire the
      butler had rushed to the plate-closet to save the silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those goblets from the high shelf! Quick!" he said, to the footman who
      was helping him, and with the haste about the goblets something else came
      tumbling down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lost diamond snuff-box!" cried the butler. "That stupid fellow I
      dismissed the day it disappeared, must have put it there and forgotten all
      about it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was soon extinguished, but not a wink of sleep could his lordship
      get until he could make reparation for the pitiful mistake about the box;
      and once more the old soldier made his way across the moors, even the
      wooden leg stepping proudly as he went along, though now and then, as the
      old feeling came over him, his white head would droop for a moment again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants stood aside respectfully as he entered the castle, and they
      and the other guests of that unlucky day gathered round him while his
      lordship told them how the box had been found and how he could not rest
      until forgiven by the brave hero he had so unjustly suspected of wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," said the company, "will you not tell us one thing more? Why did
      you refuse to empty your pockets, as all the rest were willing to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said the old soldier sorrowfully, "because I WAS a thief, and I
      could not bear that anyone should discover it! All whom I loved best in
      the world were lying sick at home, starving for want of the delicacies I
      could not provide, and I felt as if my heart would break to see my plate
      heaped with luxuries while they had not so much as a taste! I thought a
      mouthful of what I did not need might save them, and when no one was
      looking I slipped some choice bits from my plate between two pieces of
      bread and made way with them into my pocket. I could not let them be
      discovered for a soldier is too proud to beg, but oh, my lord, he can bear
      being called a thief all his life better than he can dine sumptuously
      while there is only black bread at home for the sick and weak whom he
      loves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears came streaming from the old soldier's listeners by this time, and
      each vied with the other in heaping honors and gifts in place of the
      disgrace suffered so long; but all that was powerless to make up for the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two good lessons may be learned from the story: Never believe any one
      guilty who is not really proved to be so. Never let false shame keep you
      from confessing the truth, whether trifling or of importance.

      THE AMERICAN FLAG.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 When freedom from her mountain height
      Unfurled her standard to the air,
  She tore the azure robe of night,
      And set the stars of glory there.
  She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
  The milky baldric of the skies,
  And striped its pure celestial white
  With streakings of the morning light;
  Then from his mansion in the sun,
  She called her eagle bearer down,
  And gave into his mighty hand
  The symbol of her chosen land.

 Majestic monarch of the cloud,
      Who rears't aloft thy regal form,
  To hear the tempest-trumpings loud,
  And see the lightning-lances driven,
      When strive the warriors of the storm,
  And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven&mdash;
  Child of the sun!  to thee is given
      To guard the banner of the free,
  To hover in the sulphur smoke,
  To ward away the battle stroke,
  And bid its blendings shine afar,
  Like rainbows on the cloud of war,
      The harbingers of victory!

 Flag of the brave!  thy folds shall fly,
  The sign of hope and triumph high,
 When speaks the signal trumpet tone,
  And the long line comes gleaming on.
  Ere yet the life-blood warm and wet
  Has dimmed the glistening bayonet,
  Each soldier's eyes shall brightly turn
  To where thy sky-born glories burn;
  And, as his springing steps advance,
  Catch war and vengeance from the glance.
  And when the cannon's mouthings loud
  Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,
  And gory sabers rise and fall
  Like darts of flame on midnight's pall,
  Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
      And cowering foes shall sink beneath
  Each gallant arm that strikes below
      That lovely messenger of death.

 Flag of the seas!  On ocean wave
  Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave;
  When death, careering on the gale,
  Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
  And frightened waves rush wildly back
  Before the broadside's reeling rack
  Each dying wanderer of the sea
  Shall look at once to heaven and thee,
  And smile to see thy splendors fly
  In triumph o'er his closing eye.

 Flag of the free heart's hope and home,
      By angel hands to valor given;
  Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
      And all thy hues were born in heaven.
  Forever float that standard sheet!
      Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
  With freedom's soil beneath our feet,
      And freedom's banner streaming o'er us?

    <h2>
      AUNT POLLY SHEDD'S BRIGADE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Something about the Battle of Hampden?" Grandma took off her spectacles
      and wiped them reflectively "It seems to me already I have told you
      everything worth telling; but there!" in a sudden burst of recollection,
      "did I ever tell you about Aunt Polly Shedd's Brigade? That was quite an
      affair to those of us that belonged to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! do tell us about it!" called out the three childish voices in
      chorus; and Grandma only waited to knit by the seam needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've told you all about it so many times that I don't need to describe
      again that dreadful morning when the British man-of-war came up the river
      and, dropping her anchor just opposite our little village of Hampden, sent
      troops ashore to take possession of the place in the King's name. So what
      I am going to tell you now is how, and where, we youngsters spent the
      three days that the British occupied our houses. I was about twelve years
      old at the time. I remember that it was just as we were getting up from
      the breakfast-table that one of our neighbors, Sol Grant, old General
      Grant's youngest son, rushed in without knocking, his face as white as a
      sheet, and his cap on hind-side before, and called out hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Mr. Swett, if you love your family, for God's sake find a place of
      safety for 'em! The British are coming ashore&mdash;three boat-loads of
      'em, armed to the teeth&mdash;and they won't spare man, woman nor child!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother's face grew very pale, but she stepped quietly around, with her
      baby on her arm, close to where father was standing, and laid one hand on
      his arm, while she said, in a firm, clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'MY place is with you, Benjamin, but we must think of some place of
      safety for the children. Where can they go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sol was just rushing out of the door as unceremoniously as he had rushed
      in, but he stopped when he heard her ask that, long enough to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I forgot to tell you that Aunt Polly Shedd will take all the children
      put in her charge out to Old Gubtil's; that's so out of the way they won't
      be disturbed, 'specially as the old man's a Tory himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother kissed us all round, with a smile on her face that couldn't quite
      hide the tears with which her dear eyes were filled, and as she hastily
      bundled us in whatever garment came to hand, she bade us be good children,
      and make Aunt Polly and the Gubtils as little trouble as possible. Then we
      followed father out-of-doors and into the school-house yard where a score
      or more of children were already gathered&mdash;still as mice for intense
      terror. Aunt Polly, in her big green calash, and a pillow-case of
      valuables under one arm, was bustling to and fro, speaking an encouraging
      or admonitory word, as the case might be, and wearing upon her pinched,
      freckled little face such a reassuring smile that I soon felt my own
      courage rise and, dashing back the tears that had filled my eyes a moment
      before, I busied myself in pinning little Sally's blanket more closely
      about her neck and setting the faded sunbonnet upon the tangled curls that
      had not yet had their customary morning's dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Come, children,' called out Aunt Polly cheerily, 'you're all here now,
      and we'll start right off. I'll go ahead, an' all you little ones had best
      keep close to me; the bigger ones can come along behind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obedient to her order we started, following her steps across the road by
      the beeches, and up by the grocery store where a crowd of excited men were
      congregated, talking loudly with wild gesticulations, while farther down,
      toward the shore, we could catch glimpses, through the thick morning fog,
      of the blue uniforms of our militia company that had been summoned in hot
      haste to defend the town. As we filed past, I remember I heard one of the
      men on the grocery steps speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I tell you they won't leave one stone on another if they get possession
      of the town, and they'll impress all the able-bodied men and all the big
      boys into the King's service besides.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cold shiver ran over me and I caught so hard at little Sally's hand
      that the child cried out with pain, and Aunt Polly said anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Hurry up, dears! 'Tain't much more'n a mile out to Gubtil's, and you'll
      have a good nice chance to rest after we get there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just then the martial music of a fife and drum announced the landing of
      the enemy's troops, and I tell you it quickened the lagging footsteps of
      even the youngest child into a run, and we just flew, helter-skelter, over
      the rough, little-used road that led to the Gubtil farm. Aunt Polly's
      gentle tones were unheeded. All she could do was to carry the weakest in
      her arms over all the worst places, with a word of cheer, now and then, to
      some child who was not too much frightened to heed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a haven of safety the low, unpainted old farm-house looked to us, as
      we rushed, pell-mell, into the dooryard, never noticing, in our own
      relief, the ungracious scowl with which the master and mistress of the
      house regarded our advent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aunt Polly soon explained matters, taking care to assure the inhospitable
      pair that our parents would amply recompense them for the trouble and
      expense we must, of course, be to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The farmer held a whispered consultation with his wife, and I remember
      well his harsh, loud tones as he came back to Aunt Polly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'They'll HAVE to stay, I s'pose; there don't seem no help for it now.
      There's pertaters in the cellar, an' they can roast an' eat what they
      want. I'll give 'em salt an' what milk an' brown bread they want, an'
      that's what they'll have to live on for the present. As for housin' 'em,
      the boys can sleep on the hay in the barn, an' the girls can camp down on
      rugs an' comforters on the kitchen floor, that's the best I can do, an' if
      they ain't satisfied they can go furder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember just how he looked down at the troubled, childish faces
      upturned to his own, as if half hoping we might conclude to wander yet
      farther away from our imperilled homes; but Aunt Polly hastened to answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh, we'll get along nicely with milk for the little ones, and potatoes
      and salt for the big boys and girls, and we won't trouble you any more nor
      any longer than we can help, Mr. Gubtil.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "She stood upon the door-stone beside him as she spoke, a little, bent,
      slightly deformed figure, with a face shrivelled and faded like a
      winter-russet apple in spring-time, and a dress patched and darned till
      one scarcely could tell what the original was like, in a striking contrast
      to the tall, broad-shouldered, hale old man, whose iron frame had defied
      the storms of more than seventy winters; but I remember how he seemed to
      me a mere pigmy by the side of the generous, large-hearted woman whose
      tones and gestures had a protectiveness, a strength born of love and pity,
      that reassured us trembling little fugitives in spite of our ungracious
      reception. We felt that Aunt Polly would take care of us, let what would
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hours dragged slowly away. Aunt Polly told us that the distant firing
      meant that our men had not retreated without an effort to defend the
      village. When this firing ceased, we began to watch and hope that some
      message would come from our fathers and mothers. But none came. We
      wondered among our little selves if they all had been put to death by the
      British, and even the oldest among us shed some dreary tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan Parsons, who was the biggest boy among us and of an adventurous turn,
      went in the gathering twilight gloom down as near the village as he dared.
      He came shivering back to us with such tales of vague horror that our very
      hearts stopped beating while we listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I crep' along under the shadder of the alders and black-berry bushes,'
      he began, ''til I got close ter De'con Milleses house. 'Twas as still as
      death 'round there, but jest as I turned the corner by the barn I see
      somethin' gray a-flappin' and a-flutterin' jest inside the barn door. I
      stopped, kind o' wonderin' what it could be, when all at once I thought I
      should 'a' dropped, for it came over me like a flash that it might be'&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What, what, Dan?' cried a score of frightened voices; and Dan replied
      solemnly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'THE OLD DEACON'S SKULP!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh dear! oh dear!' sobbed the terrified chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aunt Polly could do nothing with us; and little Dolly Miles, the deacon's
      granddaughter, burst into a series of wild lamentations that called Farmer
      Gubtil to the door to know the cause of the commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What's all this hullabaloo about?' he asked crossly; and when he had
      heard the story he seized Dan and shook him till his teeth chattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'What do you mean by tellin' such stuff an' scarin' these young ones ter
      death?' he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dan wriggled himself from his grasp and looked sulkily defiant:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I didn't say 'TWAS that,' he muttered. 'I said it MIGHT be, an' p'r'aps
      'twas; or it might 'a' been the deacon's old mare switchin' 'er tail ter
      keep off the flies. I'm sure <i>I</i> don't know which 'twas. But girls
      are always a-squealin' at nothin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with this parting fling at us tearful ones, Dan turned in the
      direction of the barn; but I was too anxious to hear from father and
      mother to let him go without a word more. 'Dan,' I whispered with my hand
      on his arm, 'did you see or hear anything of OUR folks?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No!' was the rather grump reply; 'after what I saw at the deacon's I
      didn't want ter ventur' furder, but from there I could see 'em lightin'
      fires in the village, an' I don't doubt by this time that most o' the
      houses is in flames.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this comforting assurance Dan went off to his bed upon the haymow,
      and I crept back into the house and laid my tired head down upon Aunt
      Polly's motherly lap, where, between my sobs, I managed to tell what Dan
      had told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aunt Polly laid a caressing hand upon my hair: 'La, child,' said she
      soothingly, 'don't you worry yourself a bit over Dan Parson's stories.
      That boy was BORN to tell stories. The Britishers are bad enough, but they
      ain't heathen savages, an' if the town has surrendered, as I calc'late it
      has, the settlers will be treated like prisoners o' war. There won't be no
      sculpin' nor burnin' o' houses&mdash;no, dear. And now,' giving me a
      little reassuring pat, 'you're all tired out, an' ought ter be asleep.
      I'll make up a bed on this rug with a cushion under your head, an' my big
      plaid shawl over you, an' you'll sleep jest as sound as if you was ter
      home in your own trundle-bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little Sally shared my rug and shawl, and Aunt Polly, gently refusing the
      ungracious civility of the old couple, who had offered her the use of
      their spare bedroom, after seeing every little, tired form made as
      comfortable as possible with quilts and blankets from the farmwife's
      stores, laid herself down upon the floor beside us, after commending
      herself and us to the God she loved and trusted, raised her head and spoke
      to us once more in her sweet, hopeful, quavering old tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good night, dears! Go to sleep and don't be a bit afraid. I shouldn't
      wonder if your folks come for you in the mornin'.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "What comfort there was in her words! And even the very little ones, who
      had never been away from their mothers a night before in their lives,
      stopped their low sobbing and nestled down to sleep, sure that God and
      Aunt Polly would let no harm come to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next day passed slowly and anxiously for us all. From a stray
      traveller Aunt Polly learned that the village was still in the hands of
      the British and&mdash;what was no little comfort to us&mdash;that no
      violence had been done to the place or its inhabitants. Some of the older
      boys were for venturing to return, but Aunt Polly held them back with her
      prudent arguments. If their parents had considered it safe for them to
      come home they would have sent for them. The British, she said, had been
      known to impress boys, as well as men, into service, and the wisest way
      was to keep out of their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentle, motherly advice prevailed, and even Dan Parsons contented
      himself with climbing the tallest trees in the vicinity, from which he
      could see the chimneys of several of the nearest houses. From these
      pinnacles he would call out to us at intervals:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The smoke comin' out o' Deacon Mileses chimly has a queer look,
      somethin' like burnin' feathers I shouldn't wonder a mite if them
      Britishers was burnin' up his furnitoor! Sam Kelly's folks hain't had a
      spark o' fire in their fireplace to-day. Poor critters! Mebbe there ain't
      nobody left ter want one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "With these dismal surmises, Dan managed to keep our forlorn little flock
      as uncomfortable as even he could wish; and as the second night drew on, I
      suppose the homesickness of the smaller ones must have been pitiful to
      see. Aunt Polly patted and cuddled the forlorn little things to the best
      of her ability, but it was past midnight before the last weary, sobbing
      baby was fairly asleep, while all night long one or another would start up
      terrified from some frightful dream, to be soothed into quiet by the
      patient motherly tenderness of their wakeful protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next morning the brow of the farmer wore an ominous frown, and his wife,
      as she distributed to each the scant measure of brown bread and milk
      remarked, grudgingly, that she should think 'twas 'bout time that her
      house was cleared of a crowd o' hungry, squallin' young ones; and then Mr.
      Gubtil took out his account-book and wrote down the name of each child,
      with an estimate of the amount of bread, milk and potatoes consumed by
      each. He did this with the audible remark that 'if folks thought he was
      a-feedin' an' a-housin' their young ones for nothin' they'd find
      themselves mightily mistaken.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The third morning dragged slowly away. Dinner was over and still no
      message for us forlorn little ones. At last Aunt Polly slowly arose from
      her seat upon the doorstep, with the light of a strong, courageous resolve
      on her little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Children!' she called loudly, and after we had gathered at her call, she
      spoke to us with an encouraging smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I've made up my mind that 'twon't be best for us to stay here another
      night. We're in the way, and the little ones would be better off at home
      with their mothers. We know that the fightin' is all over, and I don't
      believe the English soldiers'll be bad enough to hurt a lot o' little
      helpless children, 'specially if they're under a flag o' truce.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here she drew a handkerchif from her pocket. This she fastened carefully
      to a stick. Then putting it into the hands of my brother Ben, a well-grown
      lad of twelve, she went on with her directions:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'We'll form in procession, just as we came, and you, Benjie, may march at
      the head with this white flag a-wavin' to let them know that we come in
      peace. I'll follow next with the biggest boys, and the girls, with the
      little ones, must keep behind where it's safest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it was the contagion of Aunt Polly's cheerful courage, but more
      likely it was the blessed hope of seeing home and father and mother again,
      that made the little folks so prompt to obey her directions. We formed
      ourselves in line in less time than it takes to tell about it; we elder
      girls took charge of the wee ones who were so rejoiced to leave the
      inhospitable roof of the Gubtils' that they forgot all their fears of the
      terrible English, and trotted along as blithely over the deserted road as
      if not a fear had ever terrified their childish hearts, and as if English
      soldiers were still simply those far-off monsters that had served as
      bugbears to frighten them now and then into obedience to maternal
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Gubtils watched us off without a word of encouragement or
      friendliness. Aunt Polly walked close behind the flag-bearer with a firm
      step, but I could see that she was very pale, and when we came to descend
      the little hill that led into the village, and when just at its foot,
      where then stood the grocery of old Penn Parker, we caught a glimpse of
      the scarlet uniforms of several soldiers loafing about&mdash;then even we
      children could see that her steps faltered; and I remember I thought she
      was fearful of some violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the next moment she was walking steadily along again as if no thought
      of danger or retreat had ever entered her mind; and as we came opposite
      the grocery and a tall man in an officer's uniform strolled out toward us
      with a curious, questioning look upon his handsome face, she gave the word
      of command to her little brigade in a voice as clear as a bell:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Halt, children!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all stood still as mice, eying the stranger with looks in which fear
      and admiration were probably curiously blended, while Aunt Polly, taking
      the white flag from her color-bearer, advanced with a firm front to meet
      the foe who now, reinforced by several men, stood beside the way,
      evidently wondering what this queer parade was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sir!' and Aunt Polly's voice trembled perceptibly but she waved the
      white flag manfully under his very nose, 'sir, I demand a safe passage for
      these innocent children to their different homes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The officer stared, and his mouth twitched mischievously as if he had
      hard work to keep from laughing outright. But he was a gentleman; and when
      he spoke, he spoke like one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My good woman,' he said kindly, 'these children are nothing to me. If
      you wish permission for them to go to their own homes you are welcome to
      it, though in what way the matter concerns me I must confess I am at a
      loss to imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and not till then, Aunt Polly broke down and sobbed aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Run, children,' she cried as soon as she could speak; 'go home just as
      fast as you can scud; an' tell your folks,' she added with a gust of
      gratitude, 'that there's worse folks in the world than an Englishman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be sure that we waited for no further urging; and as we flew,
      rather than ran, in the direction of our different homes, I heard the
      irrepressible burst of laughter with which the officer and his men
      received the grateful spinster's compliment which, to the day of her
      death, she loved to repeat whenever she told the thrilling story of her
      adventure with the English officer, 'when Hampden was took by the British
      in 1814;' always concluding with this candid admission:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'An' really, now, if he'd 'a' been anybody but an Englishman, an' an
      inimy, I should 'a' said that I never sot eyes on a better-built, more
      mannerly man, in all my born days.'"

    Inside of me says I am naughty,

     For if Brother Joe could see me
         Right in this very same spot,
     He'd let me do just
              what I'm doing,
         I'm very sure; that is,
              perhaps.   Oh dear!  however do
              big folks
         Hold this thing
              straight in their
              laps?

    It slips, an' it slips, an'
              it slips,
         You naughty old
              Banjo, oh dear!

    Is he coming?  then what
              will he do
         To find me sitting up
              here!   Ho, ho!  'twas a mouse
              &mdash;how silly
   An' frightened I've actually been;
   For he'd say, "If you hold it quite still,
   You may take it, I'm willing, Corinne!"

    I know: so now I'll begin it;
         How does he go "tum-ty tum ting,"
     An' make such beautiful tunes;
         Too lovely for anything?
     I ain't a bit 'fraid they may hear,
         &mdash;The house-people 'way off below&mdash;
     Me playing in Brother Joe's room,
         Still I better be careful, you know.

    If they didn't say 'twas amusing,
         I sh'd think 'twas stupid to play,
     To tug at such tiresome strings
         An' make them come over this way;
     But it must be delightful.  I'll pull
         A very fine tune at first;
     Now, "tum-ty ting tw-a-n-g!"
         It sound's as if something had burst!

    That string must 'a' truly been cracked,
         Don't you s'pose?  or moth-eaten, p'raps;
     'Tisn't pleasant to practice, I'm sure,
         But forlorn, when anything flaps.

     And when I tried to catch him
         Kicked up his heels
              and ran away.

    <h2>
      BARBARA FRIETCHIE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Up from the meadows rich with corn,
  Clear in the cool September morn,

 The clustered spires of Frederick stand
  Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.

 Round about them orchards sweep,
  Apple and peach-tree fruited deep,

 Fair as a garden of the Lord
  To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,

 On that pleasant morn of the early fall,
  When Lee marched over the mountain-wall&mdash;

 Over the mountains winding down,
  Horse and foot, into Frederick town&mdash;

 Forty flags with their silver stars,
  Forty flags with their crimson bars,

 Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
  Of noon looked down, and saw not one.

 Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
  Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;

 Bravest of all in Frederick town,
  She took up the flag the men hauled down:

 In her attic window the staff she set,
  To show that one heart was loyal yet.

 Up the street came the rebel tread,
  Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.

 Under his slouched hat, left and right,
  He glanced: the old flag met his sight.

 "Halt"&mdash;the dust-brown ranks stood fast,
  "Fire!"&mdash;out blazed the rifle-blast.

 It shivered the window, pane and sash;
  It rent the banner with seam and gash.

 Quick as it fell from the broken staff,
  Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;

 She leaned far out on the window sill,
  And shook it forth with a royal will.

 "Shoot if you must this old gray head,&mdash;
  But spare your country's flag," she said.

 A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
  Over the face of the leader came;

 The nobler nature within him stirred
  To life at that woman's deed and word.

 "Who touches a hair of yon gray head
  Dies like a dog!  March on!" he said.

 All day long through Frederick street
  Sounded the tread of marching feet.

 All day long that free flag tossed
  Over the heads of the rebel host;

 Ever its torn folds rose and fell
  On the loyal winds that loved it well;

 And through the hill-gaps, sunset light
  Shone over it with a warm good-night.

 Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,
  And the rebel rides on his raids no more.

 Honor to her!&mdash;and let a tear
  Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.

 Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,
  Flag of Freedom and Union wave!

 Peace, and order, and beauty, draw
  Round thy symbol of light and law;

 And ever the stars above look down
  On thy stars below at Frederick town!

               JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER.

    <h2>
      SHERIDAN'S RIDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      (Used by special arrangement with J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia,
      publisher of Mr. Read's Poems.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Up from the South at break of day,
     Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay,
     The affrighted air with a shudder bore,
     Like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door,
     The terrible grumble and rumble and roar,
     Telling the battle was on once more,
     And Sheridan twenty miles away.

    And wilder still those billows of war
    Thundered along the horizon's bar,
     And louder yet into Winchester rolled
     The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,
     Making the blood of the listener cold
     As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,
     And Sheridan twenty miles away.

    But there is a road from Winchester town,
     A good, broad highway leading down;
     And there through the flash of the morning light,
     A steed as black as the steeds of night,
     Was seen to pass as with eagle's flight&mdash;
     As if he knew the terrible need,
     He stretched away with the utmost speed;
     Hills rose and fell&mdash;but his heart was gay,
     With Sheridan fifteen miles away.
       Still sprung from these swift hoofs, thundering South,
     The dust, like the smoke from the cannon's mouth,

    Or the trail of a comet sweeping faster and faster,
     Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster;
     The heart of the steed and the heart of the master,
     Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,
   Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;
     Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,
     With Sheridan only ten miles away.

    Under his spurning feet the road
     Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed;
     And the landscape sped away behind
     Like an ocean flying before the wind.
     And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,
     Swept on with his wild eyes full of fire,
     But lo!  he is nearing his heart's desire&mdash;
     He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,
     With Sheridan only five miles away.

    The first that the General saw were the groups
     Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops;
     What was done&mdash;what to do&mdash;a glance told him both,
     And striking his spurs with a terrible oath,
     He dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzahs,
     And the wave of retreat checked its course there because
     The sight of the master compelled it to pause.
     With foam and with dust the black charger was gray,
   By the flash of his eye, and his red nostrils' play,
     He seemed to the whole great army to say,
     "I have brought you Sheridan all the way
     From Winchester down to save the day!"

    Hurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!
      Hurrah, hurrah for horse and man!

    And when their statues are placed on high
     Under the dome of the Union sky&mdash;
     The American soldiers' Temple of Fame&mdash;
     There with the glorious General's name
     Be it said in letters both bold and bright:
     "Here is the steed that saved the day
   By carrying Sheridan into the fight,
   From Winchester&mdash;twenty miles away!"

    <h2>
      THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Between the dark and daylight,
      When the night is beginning to lower,
  Comes a pause in the day's occupations
      That is known as the Children's Hour.

 I hear in the chamber above me
      The patter of little feet,
  The sound of a door that is opened,
      And voices soft and sweet.

 From my study I see in the lamp-light,
      Descending the broad hall-stair,
  Grave Alice and laughing Allegra,
      And Edith with golden hair.

 A whisper, and then a silence;
      Yet I know by their merry eyes
  They are plotting and planning together
      To take me by surprise.

 A sudden rush from the stairway,
      A sudden raid from the hall!
  By three doors left unguarded
      They enter my castle wall!

 They climb up into my turret,
      O'er the arms and back of my chair;
  If I try to escape, they surround me,
      They seem to be everywhere.

 They almost devour me with kisses;
      Their arms about me entwine,
  Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen
      In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!

 Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti,
      Because you have scaled the wall,
  Such an old Mustache as I am
      Is not a match for you all?

 I have you fast in my fortress,
      And will not let you depart,
  But put you down in the dungeon,
      In the round-tower of my heart.

 And there I will keep you forever,
      Yes, forever and a day,
  Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
      And moulder in dust away.

    <h2>
      CARYL'S PLUM.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           "He put in his thumb
           And pulled out a plum."
</pre>
    <p>
      So sang Caryl over the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now if HE pulled out a plum, why shouldn't SHE?" she said to herself,
      halting a bit by the landing window. "And a good big plum too&mdash;nice
      and juicy. O Aunt Sylvia, Aunt Sylvia!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She fairly hugged herself in glee, then drew one long breath and dashed on
      to her own poor little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you here, Viny?" she exclaimed in surprise as she flung open the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small figure rose to a perpendicular position in front of the old
      bureau, while a shoving-to of the under drawer proclaimed some attention
      having been paid to the pretty laces, ribbons, and various other
      adornments packed away for safe keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caryl remembered leaving the key in the drawer after taking out a bit of
      lavender ribbon the night before for Aunt Sylvia's cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been doing?" she asked sharply; and taking hold of the
      small wiry shoulder, she looked down into a little black face whose eyes
      were staring solemnly into the farthest corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ben doin'?" repeated Viny, scared almost to death inwardly, but
      preserving a cool exterior. "Nothin', only shettin' the draw'; plaguey
      thing wouldn't stay put. Tore my dress," she added mumblingly to fill out
      the pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" said Caryl, looking sharply at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dar," said Viny, with a violent twist, so that she could compass the back
      breadths of her blue gingham frock, and she pointed abruptly to a
      cat-a-cornered rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, you didn't," contradicted Caryl, looking her through and through,
      and giving her a small shake, "tear that either; I heard Maum Patty scold
      you yesterday for letting Jip bite it and snip out a piece."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, somefin tore," said Viny. "I donno whar 'tis, but it's somewhars. A
      mighty smart tare, too, Miss Ca."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll lock, and lock, and lock," declared the young girl, now down on her
      knees before her precious drawer, "before I run the chance of your
      rummaging fingers getting here again. Now then, Viny!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes'm," said the little black girl obsequiously, and rolling her eyes to
      all quarters; "Oh, yes'm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going to move, Viny," said her young mistress, taking the key out
      of its lock, and turning her back on drawers and contents, to sit on the
      floor with hands folded in her lap while she watched the effect of her
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "MOVE?" echoed Viny with a start; "Oh, lawks! whatever's dat, Miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, go to a new place," said Caryl, laughing in spite of herself. "For
      mercy's sake, child, do take your eyes in! It'll be very fine, Viny, oh,
      so fine!" she cried enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' lib here nebber no mo'?" cried the little black figure in a shrill
      scream; "wot, an' hev no leaky sink dat keps me a-swashin' and a-swashin',
      an' no old ruf dat lets in hull buckets full o' water onter de bed, an'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Caryl, interrupting the steady stream of invective against the
      old heuse, "everything's to be as new and nice and neat as a pin, Viny&mdash;sinks
      and everything else; you can't begin to think how splendid it's to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm goin' to tell gramma," cried Viny, wholly off her balance, "dis berry
      same minnit. Lawks! but won't she be tickled to leave the ole shell! Den
      I'll git my bunnet an' go wid yer, Miss Ca, in tree shakes of a lobster's
      whisker!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She scampered in the greatest excitement to the door, when a detaining
      pull on the end of her long apron, brought her to a full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are crazy, child!" exclaimed Caryl, bursting into a laugh and holding
      her fast. "We can't go this moment, no matter how bad the old house is.
      Listen, Viny!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the small figure flung itself into a heap on the floor so suddenly
      that she nearly pulled her young mistress with her, while the little black
      hands clapped themselves over the bead like eyes, wail after wail of
      disappointment making the room to ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you STOP!" cried Caryl in perfect despair. "Aunt Sylvia's head will
      snap with your noise! If you don't stop crying, Viny, you sha'n't go when
      the rest of us are ready to move, so there, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Threats had the power to do what nothing else could. Viny wiped off all
      the tears with the backs of her grimy little paws, gave two or three
      concluding sniffs, sat up straight, and was immediately all right for
      further developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now then"&mdash;Caryl pointed off her sentences briskly on the tips of
      her rosy fingers&mdash;"you must try to help&mdash;well, an awful great
      deal, Viny, yourself, or else it can't be a moving for any single one of
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viny's eyes widened fearfully, but she didn't stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will take care&mdash;mind! SPLENDID care of Aunt Sylvia every
      morning," said Caryl slowly and with extreme empressment&mdash;"watch and
      get her everything she wants, not wait for her to ask for anything, then I
      can go off down street and make lots and lots of money, Viny. Think of
      that, lots and lots! Then we can move, and Aunt Sylvia will maybe get
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Caryl's gray eyes were only a thought less big than those of her small
      black audience, who presently caught the infectious enthusiasm and emitted
      several lusty crows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jiminy&mdash;oh, I DIDN'T say it&mdash;I didn't&mdash;I didn't! O Jiminy,
      I didn't&mdash;I didn't&mdash;O Jimmy, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop saying it, then," exclaimed her young mistress decidedly, and
      enforcing her words by a vigorous shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I didn't&mdash;I will&mdash;O Jiminy! yes, I will!" cried the little
      black delinquent, the full tide of original sin taking an unfair advantage
      of her excitement to engulf her. "Oh&mdash;er&mdash;oh&mdash;er&mdash;r&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caryl came to her rescue by giving her a new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See how splendid you can be, Viny dear," she said kindly. "You can be
      such a good little helper, so that part of the new home will be of your
      getting; for I never could have the chance to earn anything if you didn't
      take my place and be Aunt Sylvia's nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know how," said Viny, perfectly overcome with the greatness thrust upon
      her; "it's to slip crickets under her feet to put her toes onter. I'll
      slip 'em all day. An' it's to wipe her specs, an' to say yes, no, an' to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be good," finished Caryl solemnly; "that comprehends the whole
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be good," repeated the small nurse yet more solemnly, "an' to compren'
      the whole bus'ness; I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a ridiculous child," cried Caryl impatiently; "I don't really
      suppose you are fit to be trusted, but then, it's the only thing to try."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viny, having been duly elected to office, considered her honors settled,
      so she was little disturbed by any opinions that might be held concerning
      her. Therefore she squatted and wriggled in great delight, grinning at
      every word that fell from her young mistress' lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Viny," Caryl was saying, beginning on her confidence, "I've got
      an order to teach the little Grant girls how to paint, and if I can run
      down there two hours every morning, I'm to have twenty-five dollars, and
      Madam Grant is going to give it to me in advance; that is, after the first
      quarter. Think, Viny, TWENTY-FIVE dollars! That's what we want to move
      with into Heart's Delight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the upstairs southwest corner of a little cottage that for a year
      or more had been the desideratum of the young girl's highest hopes that
      had to wear themselves out in empty longings, the invalid's scanty
      exchequer only sufficing for doctor's bills and similar twelvemonth, along
      with several other broken-down lodgers whose slender means compelled them
      to call this place "home"&mdash;this place where never a bit of sunshine
      seemed to come; where even the birds hated to stop for a song as they flew
      merrily over the tree-tops. And no wonder. The trees were scraggy, loppy
      old things hanging down in dismal sweep over the leaky roof and damp
      walls. They had to stay&mdash;the lodgers, but the birds and the sunshine
      tossed off the whole responsibility of life in such a gloomy old home, and
      flitted to gayer quarters. But now, what if Heart's Delight could really
      be theirs!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yer goin' ter tell 'em how to paint dem tings yer daub?" broke in Viny,
      and snapping off this delightful thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't speak so, child," said Caryl with the greatest dignity;
      "it's very fine work, and you couldn't possibly understand it. It's art,
      Viny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, ho!" laughed the small black figure, nowise impressed and cramming
      her stumpy fingers up to her mouth to keep the laugh in as she saw her
      young mistress' displeasure. "It's an awful old dirty muss, an' I wish I
      could do it," she added under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I shall begin tomorrow," declared Caryl with still greater dignity,
      and drawing herself to her full height. "Aunt Sylvia says she'll try you.
      Now you'll be good, won't you?" she added anxiously. "It's only for two
      hours a day, Viny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be good," declared Viny, "'strue's I live an' breeve." Meanwhile the
      darkest of plans ran riot in her little black head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heart's Delight&mdash;Heart's Delight!" sang Caryl's happy voice all that
      day; and like St. Patrick's poor imprisoned snake, she began to feel that
      to-morrow would never come.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hours come and go, and Caryl awoke the next morning, the brightest,
      cheeriest morning that ever called a happy girl out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aunt Sylvia won't have many more days in that dark little room of hers,"
      she cried to herself, throwing on her clothes rapidly. "Oh, dear, where
      ARE the pins? I can't bear to wait a minute any more than Viny, when I
      think of that dear lovely nest, and the bay-window, and all that sunshine.
      I'll always have it full of flowers, and the bird shall sing all the time,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest was lost in a dash of cold water over the rosy face, and Caryl
      soon presented herself at her aunt's bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do well enough while you are gone," said her aunt, smiling up from
      the pillows into the bright face above hers. "Now you're not to worry
      about me in the least, for you cannot do justice to yourself if your mind
      is troubled. Remember, Caryl, and be thorough in your efforts to teach
      your little pupils."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Madam Grant is going to buy some of my panels and little plaques, I
      almost know," cried Caryl, bustling around for her aunt's long woolen
      wrapper and her day slippers, "for she told me she should want to see them
      some time. Then, Auntie&mdash;oh, then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl in her eagerness climbed upon the old bed to lay her fresh
      young cheek against the pale thin one. How she longed to put brightness
      into the poor invalid's life!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember," said Aunt Sylvia lightly, to hide the tears in her voice,
      "your fortune's to be made. Only be prompt and thorough, and put your
      whole mind to your work. That is the secret of success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, Auntie, oh, I WILL!" cried Caryl happily, "and Viny will do well,
      I guess," she added, the gleeful tones dropping down with an anxious note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Viny will prove a capital little nurse, I expect," said Miss Sylvia
      cheerfully; "now the day won't wait, Caryl, so get your old auntie up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My old auntie is just LOVELY," cried the girl, hopping off from the bed,
      and flying around merrily, well pleased at last when the invalid was in
      her chair, to see a little faint, pink color stealing up the wan cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best cap, Aunt Sylvia&mdash;the best cap!" she cried, running for the
      one with the fresh lavender ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an extravagant puss!" exclaimed Aunt Sylvia, willing to humor the
      gay little heart, and tapping her cheek as the young girl settled the cap
      on the lovely gray hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything must be best to-day," cried Caryl recklessly. "It's all fresh
      and new and fine! All the world is made just for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maum Patty saw Caryl run down the dirty little brick path that served for
      all the lodgers in the old house as a walk to the broken-down gate, with
      her color-box under her arm, and her little roll of pictures in her hand,
      and heaved a sigh from her ample bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat chile can't make no fortin' like she's a-tinkin' of, but laws! let
      her try. Here, yer Viny, yer, be off up to de Missis' room. Scat now! De
      pore lettle lamb," she mourned, as her hopeful grandchild unwillingly
      dragged her recreant feet off to her duties, leaving her grandmother to
      pursue her reflections in peace, "it mos' busts my heart to see her
      a-workin' an' de Missis keepin' up an' pretendin' she's as fine as a
      queen. 'Twarn't so in ole Patty's day. Den dar wos plenty-pies and
      turkeys. Lors, what stumpers! An' hull bar'ls o' flour, an' sugar, an' a
      creation sight of eberyting in de beyeutiful house, an' now look at dis
      ole shell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Maum Patty tossed her turban in intense scorn at each of the dark
      soot-begrimed walls of the place called kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Missis ud feel more like folks," she said at each disdainful scrutiny,
      "an' like as not git well, ef we cud cut sticks inter anudder home. Ef de
      chile only CUD do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She peered anxiously down the dirty little brick walk again, then fetched
      a still longer sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't darst to!" she declared in a mighty burst at last. "I don't, cos
      wot ud keep us all from the pore-'us den. It's every speck I kin do ter
      keep along of de Miss an' Car'l an' take keer of 'em wi'dout a cent o'
      pay; I don't darst tech my stockin' bag in de bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maum Patty always spoke of her scanty savings deposited in the neighboring
      bank, in this way, fondly supposing them in the original condition in
      which ten years ago, she had taken them there for future shield against
      sickness and old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the little black nurse had begun her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peering around Miss Sylvia's half-closed door, Viny exclaimed to herself,
      "Umph! she don't want me; guess she's a'readin' now. I'll git into Miss
      Ca's room an' try on all her clo'es an' pertend I'm makin' calls, an' peek
      inter ebery single place whar I kin, an' I'll be a lady, an' dar sha'n't
      no one scold Viny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Viny," called Miss Sylvia's soft voice, hearing a rustle at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat's Jip she's a-talkin' ter, I reckon," said Viny, stealing off on her
      tiptoes down the hall, and sticking her fingers in her ears that she might
      hear no more troublesome conscience calls; "I seen him on de rug when I
      peeked in de crack. Now den&mdash;Whoop, says I, WHOOP!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was safe now in Caryl's room, where the first thing she did was to
      indulge in a series of somersaults over the floor, and also, for variety,
      over the neat little white bed. These afforded her intense comfort. When
      she came up bright and shining after this celebration of her independence,
      she drew herself up with a serious face and proceeded at once to stern
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two hours ain't long," she observed wisely, "an' I mus' be back some of
      de time. Jiminy! she's forgot de key again!" In truth, Caryl in her great
      excitement of hunting for some pictures packed away in her precious
      drawer, had forgotten to pocket the key that protected her few treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthlessly, then, they were pulled out and overhauled, while Viny reveled
      in each new discovery, chattering softly to herself in glee. She tied on
      all the bright bits of ribbons she could lay her hands on, to the little
      tiny tails adorning her head. She twisted with great difficulty into a
      delicate white spenser that Caryl's mother had worn when a girl, saved for
      its tender reminiscence, and for the soft, fine old lace that would be of
      use to the young daughter by and by. Viny was nowise disturbed in her
      enjoyment at certain ominous crackings and creakings that proclaimed the
      giving way of the delicate material. Arrayed at last to her satisfaction,
      although the lace did hang down in some shreds where her impatient fingers
      had clutched it, she whirled and whirled in front of the old-fashioned
      glass with many grimaces, trying the effect of her new costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want sumfin to shine," she said at last, tired of this; "jew-EL-lery
      an' stuns. Le's see ef she's got any."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in one corner of Caryl's drawer was a small black box; unfortunately,
      the lock was broken in childhood, and there had been no money to spare for
      repairs of anything of that sort, so she had tied it securely with the
      strongest of twine, and written on the cover in big schoolgirl hand the
      words, "DON'T ANY ONE DARE TO TOUCH!" Although Viny was unable to decipher
      the writing in the least, it was fun enough to attack the string, which
      presently succumbed to the violent onslaught of tooth and nail, and the
      precious, precious bits of brightness were soon at the mercy of the little
      black fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maum Patty was droning away in the kitchen some old Methodist hymns. Viny
      was dimly conscious of a faint call from the invalid's room, as she drew
      out in the utmost delight an old-fashioned brooch with a green centre
      around which were some little sparkling things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She couldn't even say "Jiminy!" but simply held the pretty thing which
      seemed glad of its freedom from solitary confinement, and thus delighted
      to sparkle more than ever in its resting-place in the little black hand.
      With trembling fingers she fastened it into the centre of the lace
      spenser, above her naughty little bosom, hurrying to the glass to do so,
      and had just taken one look, when a low cry of distress struck upon her
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It filled her whole soul with dismay, rooting her like a little frozen
      thing to the spot. It was Miss Sylvia, she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one mighty effort she tore herself from the spot, and rushed headlong
      into the hall. "Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;OH!" came from the invalid's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that Viny wrung her hands and writhed in dire distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a-dyin'!" she gasped, her knees knocking together in a lively
      manner; "I don't darst to look&mdash;I don't!&mdash;I've killed her!" And
      the whole flood of remorse sweeping her very soul, she turned and scuttled
      down the crooked little stairs and into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A doctor!" was all her thought. She remembered hearing Caryl say he lived
      in a big brown house that had lots of flowers in the windows. But where
      upon the face of the earth the house was situated, Viny knew no more than
      a bird. However, she must get him, so she dashed blindly on, turning the
      first corner to run headlong into the arms of a portly old lady who was
      placidly enjoying the fresh air and sunshine at the same time that she
      displayed her rich street attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my goodness!" cried the old lady, startled out of all fine speeches
      by the collision, and jumping in fright to the extreme edge of the
      curbstone. Then seeing the cause, she cried in anger, "You miserable,
      dirty little thing you, you ve nearly killed me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word "killed," Viny began to dance in terror on the sidewalk. "I
      know it," she cried, "oh, dear, I know it! she's dead, an' grandma 'll
      beat me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you don't know any better," cried the old lady, vainly trying to
      settle her gray puffs as they were before, "than to run into people in
      this way, I'll have you arrested, I will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Viny was completely overcome. Her guilty conscience pictured all
      sorts of punishments; worse, far worse, than "grandma's" judgments, and,
      falling on her knees, she grasped the old lady's black satin gown and
      implored for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady, now her attention was drawn off from her own annoyance,
      settled her eyes on the brooch half concealed by a fold of the little lace
      spenser.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wicked, bad child!" she exclaimed, seizing her arm and pouncing one
      stiffly gloved hand on the sparkling brooch; "you've stolen that! It's bad
      enough to be run into by a dirty little thing fresh from Bedlam, without
      being wicked into the bargain. That's TOO much!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little black figure being too wretched to hear this tirade, could only
      mumble and wail and wriggle closer and closer into the folds of the rich
      gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out of my dress!" cried the old lady excitedly. "Here, I'll call the
      police; if you don't let go of me this instant! Stop, I say! Po-o-lice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Viny gave one violent jerk that brought her up to her feet, and with eyes
      distended in terror, started in wild despair across the street. A pair of
      handsome bays were coming in their best step down from the Square, drawing
      a carriage full of people who seemed in the very best of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "WHOA-A!" A click, a rapid pull-up with all Thomas's best strength, and
      the horses fell back on their haunches just in time for the little lithe
      figure to dart under their pawing hoofs and be saved! Everybody leaned out
      of the carriage for a glimpse of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;why"&mdash;A young girl's face paled, while the gray eyes
      flashed, and with one spring she was out and rushing after the small
      flying figure who in her fright had turned to flee the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look out, Caryl!" called the others in the carriage after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she'll be killed," moaned a little girl leaning out as far as she
      dared over the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then she can't ever get into the pretty new house," wailed another.
      "Oh, what shall we do! Come back, Bessie!" she cried, tugging at her
      sister's skirts. "Grandmamma, make her come into the carriage, I can't
      hold her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But a crowd of people surging up around them at this moment, took off all
      attention from Bessie and everybody else but the little fugitive and her
      kind pursuer. Caryl made her way through the crowd with flushed face, her
      little brown hat hanging by its strings around her neck, pantingly
      dragging after her the little black girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's our Viny," she said, "and something is the matter with Aunt Sylvia!
      Oh, Madam Grant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor child," said a sweet-faced woman, reaching out a kind arm, while
      the children seized hold of Caryl at every available point, between them
      dragging her and her charge into shelter, "don't be troubled. Drive just
      as fast as you can, Thomas, to No. 27, you know," she commanded hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the first thing Caryl did was to turn upon Viny and unhook the
      precious brooch as a low sob came from her white lips. "If it had been
      lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft hand stole under the little brown cloak to clasp her own; but Madam
      Grant said never a word. She knew what the young girl's heart was too full
      for speech; that the mother's brooch would speak more tenderly than ever
      she could, of forgiveness to the little ignorant black girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children were all eyes at Viny and her costume, but they said never a
      word while she howled on steadily, only ejaculating in an occasional gust,
      "O Miss Sylvy&mdash;Miss Sylvy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Caryl, white as a sheet, rushed out of the carriage and into the old
      lodging house the instant the horses paused by the broken gate. Maum Patty
      was singing in the little kitchen the refrain she never indulged in except
      in her most complacent moods. Flinging wide the door, Caryl panted out,
      "Oh, what is it! Tell me at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lawks!" exclaimed Maum Patty, startled from her peaceful enjoyment, and
      turning so suddenly in the old calico-covered chair that she sent her
      spectacles spinning into the middle of the floor. "Massy, how yer look!
      Tain't wurth it&mdash;don't! He hain't spile't it; I stopped him," she
      added exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stopped what?" echoed Caryl in bewildered distress. "Oh, do tell me!
      Is'nt Aunt Sylvia sick? Tell me, Maum Patty," she pleaded. And she grasped
      the old woman's arm in an agony of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Massy, no!" declared Maum Patty in her most cheery tones, "she's ben
      a-laughin' fit to kill herself, an' I don't wonder, for the little rascal
      looked as cunnin' as an imp. But I stopped him I stopped him!" she added
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caryl had no strength to ask further, nor to stir. The reaction was too
      great, and she leaned up against the door for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shuck it, an' shuck it," said the old woman, laughing immoderately.
      "Laws, how he shuck it&mdash;dat Jip did&mdash;yer aunt's beyeutiful cap
      with the new puppel ribbons! Ye see it tumbled off; I dunno wedder she
      sneezed, or wot she did, but anyway, it tumbled off on de flo', and dat
      little pison scamp jumped up from his rug an' cotched it, an' she
      a-callin' an'a-callin, fit ver die&mdash;I'll snake dat Viny w'en I gets
      her.&mdash;Lawks, but I couldn't help it! I laughed till I cried to see
      dat dog carry on. Luckily I run up just when I did to pay my 'specs to de
      Missis, for&mdash;I stopped him, I stopped him," she brought herself up to
      declare, wiping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Viny," said Caryl, in her little room, an hour after, when everything had
      been confessed and forgiven; when the delightful story had all come out,
      how they were really and truly to move that very afternoon; how Madam
      Grant had paid the rent in advance for the sunny rooms in the little
      cottage, and they were just driving around to surprise Aunt Sylvia when
      they witnessed Viny's escapade; how the carriage was to come before very
      long to take dear Aunt Sylvia to her longed-for refuge; how the price of
      the lessons was to go for new furniture; how everything for the rest of
      their lives was to be cheery, winsome, and bright to the very last degree&mdash;when
      it was all finished, Caryl looked kindly down into the sorry little black
      face&mdash;"Yes, Viny," she said with the happiest little laugh, "I shall
      have to forgive you, for it's the last naughty thing that you will ever do
      in the old home."

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
